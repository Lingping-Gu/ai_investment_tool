My name is Martin Viecha, VP of Investor Relations, and I'm joined today by Elon Musk, Vaibhav Taneja, and a number of other executives. Our Q4 results were announced at about 3.00 pm Central Time in the Update Deck we published at the same link as this webcast. During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC. During the question-and-answer portion of today's call, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Please use the raise hand button to join the question queue. But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?\nElon Musk: Thank you. So the Tesla team did an incredible job in 2023. We achieved record production and deliveries of over 1.8 million vehicles in line with our official guidance. And in Q4, we were producing vehicles at an annualized run rate of almost 2 million cars a year. This is really a phenomenal achievement. Looking at just the Fremont factory alone, we made 560,000 cars. This is a record. In fact, it's the highest output of automotive plants in North America. And people are often surprised that the highest output factory, car factory in North America is in the San Francisco Bay area. It's a little counterintuitive, perhaps. And it's really had an incredibly positive impact on that entire area. What would have been a rundown strip mall is the highest productivity car plant in the Americas. Think about that. It was derelict when we got it, and now it's the most productive plant in this entire part of the world. And it's enriched the community in so many different ways. It's really a gem. So I'm super proud of the people that work there. Model Y became the best-selling vehicle globally, as predicted. The best-selling vehicle of any kind, not just electric vehicles with over 1.2 million units delivered. The energy storage business delivered nearly 15 gigawatt hours of batteries in 2023, compared to 6.5 gigawatt hours the year before. So tremendous year-over-year growth, triple-digits. And yeah, I think we'll continue to see very strong growth in storage, as predicted. I said for many years that the storage business would grow much faster than the car business, and it is doing that. Free cash flow remains strong at $4.4 billion in 2023, in spite of record spending on future projects. So we had record CapEx expenses as well as record R&D. This brings us to 2024. There's a lot to look forward to in 2024. Tesla is currently between two major growth waves. We're focused on making sure that our next growth wave, driven by next-gen vehicle, energy storage, full self-driving, other projects, is executed as well as possible. For full self-driving, we've released Version 12, which is a complete architectural rewrite compared to prior versions. This is end-to-end artificial intelligence. So another bit nets basically photons in and controls out, and it really is quite a profound difference. This is currently just with employees and a few customers, but we will be rolling out to all customers in the U.S. who request full self-driving in the weeks to come. That's over 400,000 vehicles in North America. So this is the first-time AI is being used, not just for object perception, but for path planning and vehicle controls. We replaced 330,000 lines of C++ code with neural nets. It's really quite remarkable. Yeah, sort of, as a side note, I think Tesla is probably the most efficient company in the world for AI inference. Out of necessity, we've actually had to be extremely good at getting the most out of hardware, because Hardware 3 at this point is several years old. So I think we're quite far ahead of any other company in the world in terms of AI and inference efficiency, which is going to be a very important metric in the future in many arenas. So, the new Model 3 is now available globally. So we did an updated Model 3. While the car looks similar, a lot of work has gone into the vehicle to make it better in every way. It is significantly quieter, more refined, better equipped, has longer range and many other improvements, and I recommend taking it for a test drive. If you have not driven a Model 3 in a long time, you should really try the new one. So, steady improvements. And we're very far along on our next-generation low-cost vehicle. This is an earnings call, not a product announcement. So there'll no doubt be many questions that try to ask us about new product, new products coming. But we reserve product announcements for product announcements not earning calls. So -- but we're very excited about this, and this is really going to be profound, not just in its design of the vehicle itself, but in the design of the manufacturing system. This is a revolutionary manufacturing system significantly, far more advanced than any other automotive manufacturing system in the world, by a significant margin. Several years ago, I said, perhaps the most important competitive characteristic of Tesla in the future will be manufacturing technology and you will really see that come to bear with our next-gen vehicle. The first manufacturing location for this will be at our Gigafactory and headquarters in Austin, Texas, and then we'll follow that up with other locations around the world. Probably the factory we'll build in Mexico will be second, and then we'll be looking to identify a third location, perhaps by the end of this year or early next outside of North America. In conclusion, we had a great year with record production, record deliveries, and a strong free cash flow in spite of a very high interest rate environment. And we are focused on exciting new projects that will -- I think, ultimately if we execute on all these things, and it is very hard to do all these things, it's not a sure thing. But I do see a path where Tesla could one day be the most valuable company in the world. I do emphasize that is not an easy path and a very difficult one, but it is now in the set of possible outcomes and previously I would not have thought it is in the set of possible outcomes. And thank you, again to all of our investors, our employees, and our suppliers for a strong year, and looking forward to a great 2024 and years to come. Thank you.\nMartin Viecha: Thank you. And our CFO, Vaibhav has some opening remarks as well.\nVaibhav Taneja: Thanks, Martin. Good afternoon, everyone. As Elon mentioned, we had a record year in terms of both production and deliveries for our auto business as well as record deployments in our energy business. This was achieved despite 2023 being a challenging year in terms of higher interest rates and higher inflation. Big thanks to our customer for being with us through this challenging period. I would also like to thank the whole Tesla team for their resolve and dedication throughout. In terms of 2023 financials, we ended the year with over $96 billion of revenue and generated $4.4 billion of free cash flow to end the year with over $29 billion of cash and investments on hand. Our 2023 GAAP net income was impacted by the recognition of one-time non-cash benefit of $5.9 billion from the release of valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets. This was due to our recent history of sustained profitability and is similar to several other companies who have recently gone through a similar change in their account. Accordingly, starting with Q1, our book tax rate will now be more in line with other companies in the S&P 500. In our vehicle business, we continue to see improvements in our per unit cost despite us being in the early phase of Cybertruck ramp. As a result, our auto gross margin improved sequentially. That said, predicting auto gross margins is extremely challenging since there are many moving parts to this equation, some of which are out of our control like the change in tariffs or local incentives to name a few. While the teams are focused on cost reductions, we are approaching the limits within our current platforms. On the demand front, as promised, we made investments in digital campaigns in 2023. We fully appreciate the importance of customer education as we are still in a customer acquisition phase. Our data suggests that around 90% of our vehicle buyers in 2023 never owned a Tesla before. We are being creative in figuring out ways to bring in new customers and educate them about the benefits of owning a Tesla versus gas-powered vehicles. The key among them being total cost of ownership. This concept is mostly overlooked for just the upfront cost. We will be rigorous in evaluating our campaigns, curating the content, and optimizing spend accordingly to support the overall demand. There are two additional things I would like to mention as it relates to the US market. First, for customers who qualify for the IRA buyer credit, we now offer that as a point-of-sale benefit for Model Y, which means an immediate reduction of $7,500 at the time of purchase to the end customer. Secondly, we continue to offer very attractive lease rates for Model 3 and Y using our Partner Leasing Program. Note that the sales under this program are recognized as upfront revenue and reported within automotive sales. Our energy storage business had another record year with deployments more than doubling and revenues increasing by more than 50%. This business is poised to again surpass our auto business in terms of growth rate in 2024. This has been in the works for quite some time with us laying the foundation a few years back by building our Megafactory in Lathrop. I would like to thank the whole Tesla Energy team for their efforts to make this a reality. Our services and others business also started contributing meaningfully to our results and our fleets -- as our fleet grows. As we expected the fleet-based revenues from supercharging, used cars, and services continue to increase. For 2024, our focus is to continue growing our output, continuing our cost reduction efforts, and increasing investments in our future growth initiatives. Accordingly, we are currently expecting our capital expenditure for 2024 to be in excess of $10 billion. We believe this would be critical in helping us lay the foundation for the next phase of growth. Once again, I would like to thank everybody at Tesla, our investors, and our suppliers for being with us in this journey. We can open it up to questions, Martin.\nA - Martin Viecha: Thank you. Let's go through investor questions. Question number one is from Michael. Given that you moved the start of the next-generation compact vehicle production to Austin, has the timeline improved so that we might see next-generation platform vehicles in 2025?\nElon Musk: I mean, I would certainly say things with they should be taken with a grain of salt, since I am often optimistic. I don't want to blow your minds, but I'm often optimistic regarding time. But our current schedule shows that we will start production towards the end of 2025. So sometime in the second half. That's just what our current schedule says. But there's a lot of new technology like a tremendous amount of new revolutionary manufacturing technology here. The reason I wanted to put this new revolutionary manufacturing line at Giga Texas was because we really need the engineers to be living on the line. This is not sort of off the shelf, just works type of thing. And it's just a lot easier for Tesla engineering to live online if it's in Austin versus elsewhere. So -- but we are currently expecting to start production second half next year. That will be a challenging production ramp. Like, as I can emphasize we'll be sleeping on the line practically. In fact, not practically. We will be. But I am confident that once it is going, it will be head and shoulders above any other manufacturing technology that exists anywhere in the world. It's next level. So it's always difficult to predict what that S-curve of manufacturing looks like. So it always starts off real slow, and then it grows exponentially. So -- and predicting that intermediate S-curve is difficult, so I don't know. It's hard to say what the unit volume would be next year. We're not going to make any predictions on that front, but it does seem quite likely that we will start production next year.\nMartin Viecha: Thank you. The next question is from Michael again. What has been the barrier to ramping 4680 cells into the multi-million cells per week rate and when do you expect to get there?\nElon Musk: Karn?\nKarn Budhiraj: Yeah. First, I just want to allay any concerns regarding 4680 limiting the Cybertruck ramp, because I've seen some people commenting about that. To date, 4680 production is ahead of the ramp with actually weeks of finished cell inventory. And the goal is to keep it that way, not only for Cyber, but for our future vehicle programs. And as Elon said, it is an S-curve here too. It's hard to predict these things, but I'm just describing our goals.\nElon Musk: It's a hard problem.\nKarn Budhiraj: Yeah.\nElon Musk: There are entire companies where all they do is make battery cells. That's, like, all they do.\nKarn Budhiraj: Indeed, indeed.\nElon Musk: We do a lot of other things, and we got a lot of breakthrough technologies that take time to figure out with 46. It's not just that it's a 46 millimeter diameter by 80 millimeter [Indiscernible] cell. That's just the dimensions. There's tremendous amount of new technology in the cell itself.\nKarn Budhiraj: And manufacturing technology.\nElon Musk: Yes, exactly.\nKarn Budhiraj: And just regarding what the team was able to do in Q4, Texas successfully swapped line one from the Model Y design of the cell to the Cybertruck design of the cell, which was the 10% cell energy increase I've mentioned before. And as with any major new product introduction, the factory and engineering teams collaborated to ensure quality of the new design and the process changes as their first priority. And now our focus returns to cost and production ramp in Q1. And in terms of what we're doing, we're currently running one production line, one assembly line, using two assembly lines in addition for yield and rate improvement trials, and we have a fourth in commissioning, and four more will be installed starting in Q3 this year. So definitely this is a big year for ramping 4680.\nElon Musk: But we also do want to emphasize that we also expect to ramp orders from our suppliers.\nKarn Budhiraj: Yeah.\nElon Musk: So this is not about replacing our suppliers, it's about supplementing our suppliers.\nKarn Budhiraj: Yes.\nElon Musk: So we are very appreciative of our suppliers. Panasonic, obviously, is our longest supplier. They're an amazing company. We've got CATL, we've got LG and BYD.\nMartin Viecha: Thank you. The next question is from Adam. Should retail shareholders be concerned that Elon has stated that he is uncomfortable expanding AI and robotics at Tesla if he doesn't have 25% of voting?\nElon Musk: Yeah, I guess. Let me explain what my concern is here, which is that I see a path to creating an artificial intelligence and robotics juggernaut of truly immense capability and power. And my concern would be, I don't want to control it. But if I have so little influence over the company at that stage that I could sort of be voted out by some sort of random shareholder advisory firm. We've had a lot of challenges with institutional shareholder services, ISS, I call them ISIS, and Glass Lewis, which -- and there's a lot of activists that basically infiltrate those organizations and have strange ideas about what should be done. So I want to have enough to be influential. Like, if we could do a dual-class stock, that would be ideal. I'm not looking for additional economics. I just want to be an effective steward of very powerful technology. And the reason I just sort of roughly picked approximately 25% was that's not so much that I can control the company, even if I go bonkers and if I'm, like, mad, they can throw me out. But it's enough that I have a strong influence. That's what I'm aiming for, is a strong influence, but not control. If there's some way to achieve that that would be great.\nMartin Viecha: Thank you. The next question is, what is your expectation for automotive gross margin ex-regulatory credits for the full year?\nVaibhav Taneja: Like, I said in my opening remarks, we're focused on reducing the cost of our vehicles. This is very extensive and involved exercise whereby we look at not just the component cost, but down to the packaging used to get the materials to the production flow. Each element of the cost is scrutinized to optimize further. A few pennies saved at the subcomponent level, whether through engineering redesign or from many other things which I mentioned leads to cost reduction. This is a constant exercise and we just have to chase down every penny possible. We have a strong team which is hyper-focused on this. However, this is a very difficult thing to predict precisely because there are lots of...\nElon Musk: We don't know. We don't have a crystal ball, so it's difficult for us to predict this with precision. If the interest rates come down quickly, I think margins will be good. And if they don't come down quickly, they won't be that good. Yeah. It's always important to remember that the vast majority of people buying a car is about the monthly payment. It's not that people don't want. We have tons of -- we have lots of people who want to buy our car but simply cannot afford it. And as interest rates drop and that monthly payment drops, then they're able to afford it and they buy the car. It's pretty straightforward and there are no tricks around to get around this.\nMartin Viecha: Okay. Thank you. The next question is, does the company anticipate a 50% volume CAGR to be realized in either of 2024 or 2025? If not, why not?\nVaibhav Taneja: As we have said in our prior guidance, there will be periods where we won't be growing at the same rate as before. We are between two major growth waves. The first one began with the global expansion of Model 3 and Y, and we believe the next one will be initiated with the next generation platform. In 2024, our volume growth will be lower, as we have said, because we are trying to focus the team on the launch of the next generation vehicle.\nMartin Viecha: All right. Thank you very much. The next question is from Michael. When will Tesla start construction on the Giga Nevada expansion and Giga Mexico, and when can we expect each of these to produce their first products such as 4680 cell, Semi, and next-gen vehicles?\nKarn Budhiraj: We have recently broken ground for the next phase of Giga Nevada expansion to incorporate Semi and other projects. But as said earlier, as regarding Mexico, we want to first demonstrate success with the next-generation platform in Austin before we start construction. Therefore, we have started the long lead work to get the basics ready and plan to follow our recipe from the 3/Y ramp with Shanghai, where we started with learnings from Fremont and ramp really quickly.\nElon Musk: Yeah, exactly. It's important to emphasize that I mean, Model 3 production was three years of hell, I've said it before, some of the really worst years of my life, frankly. I still have mental scar tissue from those three years, as do many. And then Model Y was somewhat of a variant on Model 3. So a much easier situation. And then we were able to actually do an improved -- slightly improved versions of, in some cases, significantly improved versions of the Model Y production line in Shanghai and Berlin. And that's the right, I think the sensible way to go about things is kind of figure out the core technology of the manufacturing line and then replicate it with improvements throughout the world.\nMartin Viecha: Thank you. The next question from Michael is, has there been any progress made with an FSD licensing agreement with another company?\nElon Musk: I really think lots of car companies should be asking for FSD licenses. And we've had some tentative conversations, but I think they don't believe it's real quite yet. I think that will become obvious probably this year. And I do want to emphasize that if I were CEO of another car company, I would definitely be calling Tesla and asking to license Tesla full self-driving technology. It's definitely the smart move.\nMartin Viecha: Thank you. The next question from Siddharth. What is the timeline for Optimus first production off volume production line and what are the barriers to getting there?\nElon Musk: Optimus, obviously, is a very new product, an extremely revolutionary product, and something that I think has the potential to potential to far exceed the value of everything else that Tesla combined. When you think of an economy, economy is productivity per capita times capita. But what if there's no limit to capita? There's no limit to the economy. And the technologies that we've -- AI technologies that we've developed for the car translate quite well to a humanoid robot because the car is just a robot on four wheels. Tesla is arguably already the biggest robot maker in the world. It's just a four-wheeled robot. So Optimus is a humanoid robot with arms and legs. It's by far the most sophisticated humanoid robot that's being developed anywhere in the world. I think we've got a good chance of shipping some number of Optimus units next year. But like I said, this is a brand new product. A lot of uncertainty -- when you have -- when there's a lot of uncertainty in your uncharted territory, it's obviously impossible to make a precise prediction. But we will be updating the public with progress on Optimus every few months, and you can see that it's advancing very quickly. I was just in the Optimus lab, actually, until late last night, like red night or something, finally left the Optimus lab. The team's doing amazing work. That's obviously a case where we want to make sure that Optimus is safe, especially at scale, and that there's no -- it should be impossible for any centralized control to upload malware to a humanoid robot. So we're going to want to pull then localized shut off that cannot be updated from a central server. That's the case where we really have to give extreme thought to safety. But like I said, I do think it has the potential to be the most valuable product of any kind ever, by far.\nKarn Budhiraj: Just to comment on the barrier, I think the barrier, and we've talked about this, is like getting it to actually do something useful. Like, we can get it to walk around, we can get it do things, but it's like that utility part.\nElon Musk: We can already do some useful things.\nKarn Budhiraj: But like, to making millions of these things, it's like utility. Got to get the utility of it.\nElon Musk: Yeah. A smart robot that can do -- that's capable of doing generalized tasks is what it will be in terms of doing moderately specialized tasks. Well, it can already do that. It'll just get better through the course of the year. As we improve the technology in the car, we improve the technology in Optimus at the same time. It runs the same AI inference computer that's on the car. Same training technology. I mean, we're really building the future. I mean, the Optimus lab looks like the set of Westworld. Admittedly, that was not a super utopian situation.\nKarn Budhiraj: Yeah. Not the best reference.\nElon Musk: Yeah. The creators of Westworld, Jonathan Nolan, Lisa Joy Nolan, friends, old friends of mine, actually. And I invited them to come see the lab. I think they'll come see it, hopefully soon. It's pretty wild, especially the sort of subsystem test stands where you've just got like one leg on a test stand, just doing repetitive exercises and one arm on a test stand. Pretty wild. Yeah.\nKarn Budhiraj: We're not entering Westworld anytime soon.\nElon Musk: Right. You take safety very, very seriously.\nMartin Viecha: Thank you. The next question from Nermin is, how many Cybertruck orders are in the queue and when do you anticipate you will be able to fulfill existing orders?\nKarn Budhiraj: First of all, I want to thank all the Cybertruck reservation holders for their patience. The reservation to order conversion rates so far has been very, very encouraging. If the trend continues as it very likely to be, we will soon sold out all the builds in 2024. And also, we have new orders come in after the launch. The auto numbers keep growing. So we're now all hands on deck, focused on ramping so we can fulfill all the demands in a reduced wait time.\nElon Musk: Yeah. It's important to emphasize that this is very much a production-constrained situation, not a demand-constrained situation. And obviously, we could dramatically raise the price, but that doesn't feel right to us to sort of gouge people for early delivery. So -- but really, the demand is off the hook. As long as the price is affordable, I mean, I see us ultimately delivering on the order of 0.25 million, something like 0.25 million Cybertrucks a year in North America, maybe more. But give or take roughly on that time frame, and it sure is a head-turner.\nVaibhav Taneja: Definitely is. Anywhere you go, people look at you, they give you thumbs up.\nElon Musk: Yeah. It's like finally, the future. Looks like the future. It's just -- for the other trucks on the road there, which -- there's some very good trucks on the road, but if you were to switch out the brand name, you wouldn't hardly know which company made them, but you definitely would know the Cybertruck. That's our best product ever.\nMartin Viecha: All right. Thank you. The next question is, can we get Tesla Energy volumes reported in the production and delivery release?\nKarn Budhiraj: Yeah. We will strive to do so starting from this quarter. And just a brief update from the business perspective. Megapack continues to see strong demand signals globally, driving consistent growth trajectory through '24 and '25. We want to thank all of our partners who've put their trust in the Megapack team to execute on critical infrastructure around the world. And I would like to personally thank the Megapack engineering and production teams for their strong 2023 execution. Lathrop continues to ramp through 2024 with the operation of a second final assembly line to double capacity from 20 gigawatt to 40 gigawatt hours by the end of the year.\nMartin Viecha: Thank you. And the last investor question is from Siddharth, what are the preliminary results and return on investment of your ads and education campaign? Given that many people still lack awareness that Tesla average price is less than the average non-luxury car price of $45,000, will you expand educational ads?\nUnidentified Company Representative: As Elon mentioned, the ultimate solution to increase EV adoption is really address the affordability issue. But at the same time, we do aware there's awareness issue as well. So in Q4, we ran a series of digital campaigns, very targeted digital campaigns across different geos and different channel. The target of these tests is really just to drive awareness and ultimately measure the return of investment on those digital channels. The messaging we're driving has really focused on our product and also try to address some of the misconception of the EV, such as safety, affordability. And one particular awareness campaign we run in Texas will reach the audience, about 10 million unique viewers, and generated close to 0.5 million visits to our website. A large number of these viewers are first-time visitors to our website. The traffic through these digital channels actually behaved very similar to those organic traffic come to our website. So going forward, we're just going to keep exploring different channels and doing our trials to get a better understanding of this effectiveness of these digital campaigns.\nVaibhav Taneja: But I would also like to caution that we'll be very careful that we don't want to overspend on this side. We want to make sure people are aware. But that's where we'll keep tweaking our methodology about how and where we spend the money. Because we understand the importance of increasing awareness, but at the same token, we don't want to spend a lot of money on just creating awareness.\nElon Musk: Yeah. I mean, there are some geographies where our market share is remarkably low. Like Japan, for example. Now, we also need to make sure that we have superchargers in the right locations and the service centers are there, and the product works well in Japan. But Japan is the third largest car market in the world of any country, and we should at least have a market share proportionate to, say, other non-Japanese car makers like Mercedes or BMW, which we do not currently have. So I think that's a case -- when I talk to friends of mine in Japan, they're like -- there is quite a lack of awareness of Tesla. So that's a case where we definitely need to increase awareness in countries and regions where there is, yeah, not that much awareness.\nMartin Viecha: Thank you. Let's go to analyst questions. The first question comes from Pierre Ferragu from New Street Research. Pierre, go ahead, please. Feel free to unmute. Pierre, can you hear us?\nPierre Ferragu: Okay. Wow. It's really tough to find the unmute button on Team's guide. I'm sorry for being late. So, yes, my question would on the cost reduction, you've talked about it already a lot. And if I look at it, over the last like, five, six quarters, on average, the COGS per car has been coming down, like, more than 2% sequentially, on average. So that means you are, like, on a trajectory of COGS per car going down 10% a year. So that's probably, like, unheard of in the auto industry. I don't think any car manufacturer ever achieved that. But that's very mundane, and it's a good performance, but it's a very normal performance in a lot of other manufacturing industry, like microelectronics or consumer electronics. And so I'd love to hear your thoughts about whether you consider yourself closer to the latter to, like, a microeconomics business where you have this ability to actually always improve costs. You have more control on how things are pulled together into your cars, and you see yourself sustainably taking costs down with that kind of pace or do you think your ability to take down cost is actually going to become more like in line with the rest in the industry over time?\nVaibhav Taneja: Yeah. I think I covered this in a pretty lengthy detail, even in my opening remarks and in a previous question. But to just further clarify, we are constantly looking for what we can do to reduce cost. Like I said, it's a game of pennies. We've talked about it before as well. And the team is constantly going and checking, where can we reduce the cost further. And do I believe that we will have the same pace which you've seen over the past few years? Probably not, because remember, we were coming out with a period wherein commodity prices were rising, so then we did see benefits coming from that. So those are more or less taken care of. But there is more which we're still chasing. And I would say a big kudos goes to the team out here at Tesla, both the engineering team as well as the supply chain team, because every time we give them a challenge, they go gangbusters to try and figure out whatever they can to take out further cost. But yes, I would -- like I said, I would want to caution that do not project the previous cost reduction at the same pace completely in the future, because with our current platform, we are getting to a place wherein there are limitations.\nKarn Budhiraj: Yeah. The increased scale also sort of helps us there. As we introduce new products, we have the opportunity to go renegotiate existing suppliers for better pricing. We're looking at every penny, like Vaibhav and Elon mentioned. Just to give you an example, our inbound logistics cost has come down by 22% year-over-year. And this is because of optimization on using returnable packaging as opposed to cardboard, which is even better for the environment, optimizing trucking routes, negotiating better pricing with shipping companies, with trucking companies, going with full truckloads and just doing that, sort of. The bigger we become, the more we put thought into these things and the more efficient we become as a result of it. So those work streams are going to continue.\nUnidentified Company Representative: And we are also getting into the tiers of supply chain to see if there are opportunities, getting into the tier 2, tier 3, tier 4 levels, and then negotiate those pricing as well to get more efficiency out of the system.\nKarn Budhiraj: And then on the design side, we're not static, right, like, especially in areas where the technology is still improving rapidly. Power electronics is a great example. We continue to bring improvements there that are like fundamentals, sort of driven from the device up, that result in cost reductions, generation over generation. And they don't only go into the new vehicles, they come to the old vehicles as well. So that's closer to what you were talking about with the microelectronic space. Some of that exists in the vehicle.\nLars Moravy: Yeah. Certainly our car is more computer than car in many ways and has a lot of new tech over the last 100 years of automotive production that everyone's trying to scrape pennies from.\nElon Musk: We have a crazy amount of compute in our cars compared to anyone else. It's like orders of magnitude.\nKarn Budhiraj: And we get to ride that down, right?\nElon Musk: 1,000 times more. Some nutty number.\nKarn Budhiraj: I mean, if I just look at the main microcontroller that makes the motor truck go, for example, when I think about what it costs when we stuck it in a roadster in 2006, it costs now. There's no comparison. So we've definitely been riding that electronics cost wave.\nElon Musk: Yeah.\nLars Moravy: And then even on the like non -- what you call traditional vehicle side, we do things that no other automakers do to bring cost down through breaking down the way structures are built and the way we put our cars together. And I think that mindset that we have is very much closer to the microprocessor or power electronics industry than the automotive industry.\nMartin Viecha: Thank you. Pierre, do you have a follow-up?\nPierre Ferragu: Great. Yes, a quick one. You mentioned this phase in which you are between two big growth periods. I'd love to hear you about what you consider the size of your addressable market. With the portfolio you have today, like the three, the Y, the X, and the S, what's your estimate of your addressable market? You're shipping like, probably about like a 2 million unit run rate today and given the price points of these cars, what kind of market share of what you address with these cars do you think you've already achieved today?\nElon Musk: I don't know, if anybody -- I actually don't think we have a firm idea of this. That's hard to say exactly.\nVaibhav Taneja: Yeah. This -- I won't say there's -- I mean, one way to think about it is look at the automotive industry as well. EVs still contribute a very small market share. So, yes, our goal is to try and take as much market share out of that pie. But do I have a specific number to give you? I don't think we can say that with certainty.\nAndrew Baglino: And it's a growing pie as well.\nVaibhav Taneja: Exactly\nAndrew Baglino: It's like its 9% today, but it could be 20% in a couple of years or in the future.\nElon Musk: Yeah.\nAndrew Baglino: Certainly, like the way we've looked at it, and we've always said this, it's not about how many EVs we sell. It's how many great cars you can sell, how many vehicles you can sell. And that market is 100 million a year, and we're barely 2% of that. I still think there's 98% more to get.\nElon Musk: I mean, it's worth noting that if you look at, say, the average selling price of the other top-selling vehicles in the world, they are much lower priced than a Model Y.\nAndrew Baglino: Yeah.\nElon Musk: So like Toyota RAV4.\nAndrew Baglino: Corolla.\nElon Musk: Corolla, Honda Civic, that kind of thing. They're much lower priced than ours. So people are really stretching their wallets to be able to afford a Tesla. It's quite a difficult thing for them to do, and remarkable that it's the best-selling car in unit volume, despite being much more expensive than other high-volume cars.\nMartin Viecha: Thank you. Let's go to the next analyst. The next question comes from Adam Jonas from Morgan Stanley.\nAdam Jonas: Hey, everybody. So I can't wait to see the Optimus lab. I'm sure everybody on this call feels the same way. Your last AI Day, Elon, was September 2022. Can we expect a Tesla AI Day this year? It seems like a lot has changed in that realm. And is this year the time?\nElon Musk: Yeah, it's a good question. We have found that when we do these AI Days, some of our competitors literally look at what we do on a frame-by-frame basis.\nAdam Jonas: They do.\nElon Musk: And then we find these things being copied.\nKarn Budhiraj: Same thing with Battery Day.\nElon Musk: Same thing with Battery Day. So we have to be a little cautious about revealing the exact recipe of the secret sauce. But I think some kind of update would be good to do. I'll talk it over with the team, and yeah, I think we might do something later this year. Our main goal with these AI Day things is recruiting and to sort of change the perception of Tesla as people thinking of Tesla as a car company when they should be thinking of Tesla as an AI robotics company.\nAdam Jonas: Maybe as a follow-up. Elon, I'd love your thoughts on the topic of China-based OEMs expanding into Western markets. As the China market kind of gets saturated and there's a tremendous growth in the supply, how much success should Tesla investors allow for this competition to achieve in Western markets? And can you envision a scenario where Tesla could partner with a Chinese OEM to help accelerate sustainable transport in markets like Europe and the United States? Thanks.\nElon Musk: Well, our observation is generally that the Chinese car companies are the most competitive car companies in the world. So I think they will have significant success outside of China depending on what kind of tariffs or trade barriers are established. Frankly, I think if there are not trade barriers established, they will pretty much demolish most other car companies in the world. So they're extremely good. We don't see an obvious opportunity to partner. Certainly, we're happy to, except on the supercharger front. We're obviously happy to give any electric car company access to our supercharger network. We're also happy to license full self-driving, perhaps license other technologies, and anything that could be helpful in advancing the sustainable energy revolution.\nMartin Viecha: Thank you. And the next question comes from Dan Levy from Barclays.\nDan Levy: Hi. Good evening. Thank you for taking the questions. First, I'm wondering if you can just walk through some of the gating factors required to unlock your next-gen platform. You talked about a number of cost initiatives back at the Investor Day a year ago, things in manufacturing and powertrain. Maybe you can just give us a sense of where these initiatives stand. And do you believe -- we know that there's a number of new features and technologies in Cybertruck, things like 48 volts architecture, really employing your 4680 batteries. To what extent do you think Cybertruck is really a proving ground for the next-gen platform and is really going to be a gating factor to unlocking the cost reductions needed for the next-gen platform?\nLars Moravy: Yeah, I don't think that anything on Cybertruck should be considered gating for the next-gen platform. We're obviously doing a lot of manufacturing innovation, as Elon said, for a next-generation vehicle. When you do something at that scale, you have to prove it out. You don't just throw it on the line and just build it. So we're going through those validation phases for all those new manufacturing technologies now. Sure, 48 volts was definitely something we wanted to carry forward, and it's something we hope the industry adopts as well. We're also open to partnering.\nElon Musk: Yeah. 48 volts.\nLars Moravy: On that if everyone wants to do that.\nElon Musk: Certainly. Man, the people that really know that this is like the inside baseball thing. But man, 48, it's so high time that the water industry moved from the 12 -- the random number of 12 volts to 48 volts.\nLars Moravy: Random number of 48 volts.\nElon Musk: Yeah. Well, it's much less random.\nLars Moravy: Slightly less random based on human injury, but...\nElon Musk: I mean dramatically reduces the amount of copper you need in the vehicle and also moving to sort of higher bandwidth communications, sort of ethernet level communications versus CAN Bus, which is pretty...\nLars Moravy: Pretty slow.\nElon Musk: Pretty slow. So it's really just bringing cars to...\nLars Moravy: The 21st century.\nElon Musk: Yeah, pretty much.\nLars Moravy: So, certainly like...\nElon Musk: It's not exact -- it's like normal for a laptop. Yeah.\nLars Moravy: Certainly bringing that like is an evolution in our architectures of vehicles, but it's not gating by any means. The gating work is just to finish the design and manufacturing of the car, test them out and get them going.\nKarn Budhiraj: Yeah, programs and execution mode, right?\nLars Moravy: Yeah.\nKarn Budhiraj: So it's talking about like, tooling lead time, manufacturing equipment lead time, factory lead time, and executing those programs.\nElon Musk: There's a lot of specialized machines that make the machine for a next-gen vehicle. So these are not machines you can just order from anyone. You have to design a machine that has never existed to build a car in a way that has never existed.\nKarn Budhiraj: Yeah. So you don't just have like a design validation phase, but you have an equipment design validation phase as well.\nElon Musk: It does make it very hard to copy us because you have to copy the machine that makes the machine that makes the machine.\nLars Moravy: Talk about tiers.\nElon Musk: Yeah, exactly. Manufacturing exception. So I do think it's quite a powerful sustainable advantage because there just is no place to go to order the machines that make our next-gen car that don't exist.\nDan Levy: Great. Thank you. As a follow-up, your release does not mention Dojo. So if you could just provide us an update on where Dojo stands and at what point you expect Dojo to be a resource in improving FSD or do you think that you now have sufficient supply of Nvidia GPUs needed for the training of the system?\nElon Musk: I mean, the AI hardware question is, that is a deep one. So we're obviously hedging our bets here with significant orders of Nvidia GPUs. Or GPU is the wrong word. There really needs to be -- there's no -- it doesn't -- you can't produce graphics, so that's what. It's not a graphics processing unit. Neural net processing unit or something like that. Yeah. GPU is a funny word, like Vestigial. A lot of our progress in self-driving is training limited, something that's important with training, it's much like a human. The more effort you put into training, the less effort you need in inference. So just like a person, if you train in a subject, sort of classic 10,000 hours, the less mental effort it takes to do something. If you remember when you first started to drive, how much of your mental capacity it took to drive. It was -- you had to be focused completely on driving. Then after you've been driving for many years, it only takes a little bit of your mind to drive and you can think about other things and still drive safely. So the more training you do, the more efficient it is at the inference level. So we do need a lot of training. And we're pursuing the dual path of Nvidia and Dojo. But I would think of Dojo as a long shot. It's a long shot worth taking because the payoff is potentially very high. But it's not something that is a high probability. It's not like a sure thing at all. It's a high-risk, high-payoff program. Dojo is working, and it is doing training jobs, and we are scaling it up, and we have plans for Dojo 1.5, Dojo 2, Dojo 3, and whatnot. So I think it's got potential, but I can't emphasize enough. High risk, high payoff. So I think it still makes sense given the -- even if it's a low probability of success -- I'm laboring the subject. It's a very interesting program. It has the potential for something special. There's also our inference hardware in the car. So we're now on what's called Hardware 4, but it's actually Version 2 of the Tesla-designed AI inference chip. And we're about to complete design of -- the terminology is a bit confusing. We're about to complete design of Hardware 5, which is actually Version 3 of the Tesla-designed chip. Because the Version 1 was Mobileye, Version 2 was Nvidia, and then Version 3 was Tesla. And we're making gigantic improvements from Hardware 3 to Hardware 4 to Hardware 5. I mean, there's a potentially interesting play where when cars are not in use in the future that the in-car computer can do generalized AI tasks, can run a sort of GPT-4 or GPT-3 or something like that. If you've got tens of millions of vehicles out there, even in a robotaxi scenario where they're in heavy use, maybe they're used 50 out of 168 hours, that still leaves well over 100 hours of time available -- of compute hours. It's possible with the right architectural decisions that Tesla may in the future have more compute than everyone else combined.\nMartin Viecha: Thank you. The next question comes from Colin Langan from Wells Fargo.\nColin Langan: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. As we're thinking about going into 2024, the press release talks about hitting 36,000 or slightly above in Q4. And the comments in the release talk about approaching the natural limits. And it sounds like you're continuing to try to whittle that away, but that sort of implies there's not much left. In addition, you have the hourly wage increase. I guess we'll add to that into next year. And I thought you said raw material costs are kind or -- that benefit is sort of almost played out. So is there an opportunity to continue to go below the 36,000, or should we kind of be modeling that it kind of stays at this level into '24?\nVaibhav Taneja: We are definitely aware of the cost increases which are coming through because of the wage increases. But like I said, we keep looking at other cost opportunities and try and figure out where else can we cut down. So there is definitely more opportunity to bring down costs further. I won't specifically guide to a number which we will try and get to, but there's definitely more opportunity there.\nAndrew Baglino: Yeah. We're chasing lots of cost opportunities on the design side still for 2024, north of eight figures is what we're just in my organization, and Lars has got a bunch. And then from a commodities perspective, it's such a long cycle time through the whole material supply chain that even with what we've already seen to this point...\nVaibhav Taneja: There's more to come.\nAndrew Baglino: There's more to come on commodities reductions.\nLars Moravy: And there's still some tailwind left on the commodities.\nAndrew Baglino: That's what I mean.\nLars Moravy: Aluminum and steel.\nAndrew Baglino: Yeah and battery material.\nElon Musk: It boggles my mind to think that if we make a 1% improvement in costs, that's $1 billion. So it's like, on average, if we reduce the cost by one penny, $1 billion.\nAndrew Baglino: What?\nElon Musk: And we started off that long ago that we were only making like 10 cars a week. And yeah, so where does it lead ultimately? With good execution, like I said, it's not a slam dunk, but if we execute very well, I think Tesla could be the most valuable company in the world.\nMartin Viecha: Thank you, Colin. Do you have a follow-up question?\nColin Langan: Yeah. Just a quick follow-up. In the commentary, you mentioned the taxes would go to the S&P 500 level. I think you've been trending slightly below 10%. S&P, I think, is typically 25%-ish. Is that going to -- should we expect that to jump right up next year when we're modeling next year or would it be like a gradual change over the next few years and any cash impact from that tax change as well that we should be considering?\nVaibhav Taneja: Yeah. So there's no impact on cash taxes from the release of the valuation amounts, which I spoke about. What it does is, it's how you account for taxes on your books? So it's basically an accounting change wherein there are certain jurisdictions because we had enough NOLs, etc., wherein we didn't have to accrue book taxes. Now that the valuation allowance has been released and we have recognized deferred tax assets on the books, that means your tax rate immediately goes up.\nMartin Viecha: Okay. I think that's all the time we have for today. Thank you so much for all of your questions, and we'll speak to you again in three months. Thank you. Bye-bye.\nElon Musk: Thank you."}, {"symbol": "TSLA", "quarter": 3, "year": 2023, "date": "2023-10-18 22:06:06", "content": "Elon Musk: [Call Starts Abruptly]\u2026of new factories and we believe there\u2019s still meaningful room for improvement there. Regarding Autopilot and AI, our vehicles are now driven over 0.5 billion miles with FSD beta, full self-driving beta, and that number is growing rapidly. We recently completed a 10,000 GPU cluster of H100s. We think probably bring it into operation faster than anyone\u2019s ever brought that much compute per unit time into production, since training is the fundamental limiting factor on progress with full self-driving and vehicle autonomy. We\u2019re also seeing significant promise with FSD version 12. This is the end-to-end AI where it\u2019s photon count in, controls out. Really you can think of it as there\u2019s just a large bitstream coming in and a tiny bitstream going out, compressing reality into a very small set of outputs, which is actually kind of how humans work. The vast majority of human data input is optics from our eyes. And so, we are like the car, photons in, controls out with neural nets, just neural nets in the middle. So, interesting to think about that. We\u2019ll continue to invest significantly in AI development, as this is really the mass game changer. And I mean success in this regard in the long-term I think has the potential to make Tesla the most valuable company in the world by far. If you have fully autonomous cars at scale and fully autonomous humanoid robots that are truly useful, it\u2019s not clear what the limit is. Regarding energy storage, we deployed 4 gigawatt hours of energy of storage products in Q3. And as this business grows, the energy division is becoming our highest margin business. Energy and service now contribute over $0.5 billion to quarterly profit. The Cybertruck, I know a lot of people are excited about the Cybertruck. I am too. I\u2019ve driven the car. It\u2019s an amazing product. I do want to emphasize that there will be enormous challenges in reaching volume production with the Cybertruck, and then in making a Cybertruck cash flow positive. This is simply normal for when you\u2019ve got a product with a lot of new technology or any new vehicle, brand new vehicle program, but especially one that is as different and advanced as the Cybertruck, you will have problems proportionate to how many new things you\u2019re trying to solve at scale. So, I just want to emphasize that while I think this is potentially our best product ever and I think it is our best product ever, it is going to be -- require immense work to reach volume production and be cash flow positive at a price that people can afford. Often people do not understand what is truly hard. That\u2019s why I say prototypes are easy, production is hard. People think it\u2019s the idea, or you make a prototype, you design a car. And as soon as they\u2019re designing a car, it\u2019s just anyone can do it, it does require taste, it does require effort to design a prototype. But it\u2019s difficult to going from a prototype to volume production, it\u2019s like 10,000% harder to get to volume production than to make a prototype in the first place, and then it is even harder than that to reach positive cash flow. That is why there have not been new car startups that have been successful for a 100 years apart from Tesla. So, I just want to temper expectations for Cybertruck. It\u2019s a great product, but financially it will take, I don\u2019t know, a year to 18 months before it is a significant positive cash flow contributor. I wish there was some way for that to be different, but that\u2019s my best guess. The demand is off the charts. We have over 1 million people who\u2019ve reserved the car. So it\u2019s not a demand issue, but we have to make it and we need to make it at a price that people can afford, insanely difficult things. In conclusion, we continue to focus on ramping production while maintaining positive cash flow and we continue to target -- expect to have around 1.8 million vehicle deliveries, as stated earlier this year. The Tesla AI team is I think one of the world\u2019s best, and I think it is actually by far the world\u2019s best when it comes to real world AI. I\u2019ll say that again, Tesla has the best real world AI team on earth, period, and it\u2019s getting better. And lastly, I wanted to thank all of our employees who are making a lot of extra effort during uncertain times. Thank you very much for your hard work and the impact that you\u2019re making.\nMartin Viecha: Thank you very much, Elon. And our CFO, Vaibhav, has some opening remarks as well.\nVaibhav Taneja: Thanks, Martin. Vehicle deliveries in Q3 outpaced production, and we had yet another record quarter of profitability in our energy business. Congratulations to the Tesla team for the continued focus on operational excellence as we navigate through a period of economic uncertainty, higher interest rates, and shifting consumer sentiment. As Elon mentioned, our Q3 operational and financial performance was impacted by planned downtimes for our factory upgrades. This was necessary to allow for further factory improvements and production rate increases. Despite such factory shutdowns, our cost per vehicle decreased to approximately $37,500. We saw sequential decreases in material cost and freight. Reducing the cost of our vehicles is our top priority. On the operating expenses front, R&D expenses continued to rise due to Cybertruck prototype builds and pilot production testing combined with spend on AI technologies like full self-driving, Optimus and Dojo. We have and will continue to make investments in these areas, and hence our capital expenditure and R&D will continue to grow in the near term. However, our focus is to continue making investments through positive cash flow from operations. This year itself, we have generated operating cash flows of approximately [$8.9 billion] (ph) and free cash flows of approximately $2.3 billion. Our other businesses are becoming more prominent on a standalone basis with energy business leading the charge, primarily from the growth in Megapack deployments. Our services and other businesses on a year-on-year basis also continue to show positive momentum as we benefit from our growing fleet. As regards our pricing strategy, in addition to what we have shared before, I want to elaborate that most car buying happens with one or other form of financing, and hence we also view pricing in terms of monthly costs for the customer. And therefore, as interest costs in the U.S. have risen substantially, it has required us to adjust the price of our vehicles to keep the monthly cost in parity. We\u2019ve tried to offset such adjustments via focus on reducing costs. However, there is an inherent lag in cost reductions, which in turn impacts margins. To that extent, we recently announced a partner vehicle leasing program in the U.S. whereby you can get a standard Model Y for as low as $399 a month. In conclusion, as we navigate through a challenging economic environment, we\u2019re focused on reducing costs, maximizing delivery volumes, and continuing making investments in the future, in particular, AI and other next generation platform. We believe this strategy positions us well for the long term. Once again, I would like to thank the Tesla team for their efforts in the last quarter.\nA - Martin Viecha: Thank you very much. And now let\u2019s go to investor questions. The first investor question comes from Craig. How many Cybertruck deliveries do you anticipate for 2024?\nElon Musk: It\u2019s difficult to make an accurate guess at this point. Going back to what I said earlier that the ramp is going to be extremely difficult. And like I said, there\u2019s no way around that. If you try to make -- if we just try to do some copycat vehicle design, of which there are literally 200 models that are slight variations on a theme in the combustion engine world, distinctions without a difference, then it\u2019s really not that hard. But if you want to do something radical and innovative and something really special, like the Cybertruck, it is extremely difficult because there\u2019s nothing to copy. You have to invent not just the car, but the way to make the car. So, the more uncharted the territory, the less predictable the outcome. Now, I can say that -- if you say, well, where will things end up? I think we\u2019ll end up with roughly a 0.25 million Cybertrucks a year, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to reach that output rate next year. I think we\u2019ll probably reach it sometime in 2025. That\u2019s my best guess.\nMartin Viecha: Thank you. The second question is, can you provide a progress update on the 4680 cell, particularly progress towards performance improvements and cost savings outlined on Battery Day? Thank you.\nUnidentified Company Representative: Sure thing, Martin. 4680 cell production in Texas increased 40% quarter-over-quarter. Congrats to the Texas team for producing their 20 million cell off of line one. Texas is now our primary 4680 facility. We\u2019re heavily focused on quality. Scrap is down 40% quarter-over-quarter. With the increased volume and yield improvements, cell costs consistently improved month-over-month within the quarter, although we have a lot more work to do to achieve our steady state goals. And that is our priority. The Cybertruck cell with 10% higher energy than our Model Y cell started production on line two in Texas. This quarter we convert to building a 100% Cybertruck cells to simplify and focus the factory as we ramp all four lines in Phase 1 over the next three quarters. Phase 2 of the Texas 4680 facility is currently under construction. The additional four lines incorporate further capital efficiencies over Phase 1, and our target is for them to start producing in late 2024. Lastly, in Kato, we\u2019re retooling to enable large scale pallet runs of our next generation cell designs. Kato\u2019s long-term goal is to be the launch pad for new cells, one generation ahead of our mass production facilities, enabling faster iteration and smoother ramp ups of new designs.\nA \u2013 Martin Viecha: Thank you. The next question from institutional investors. Could you please provide an update on capacity expansion plans for company\u2019s factories in Berlin and Austin, and the opening schedule of Gigafactory Mexico?\nA \u2013 Unidentified Company Representative: Berlin and Austin factories, the current priority is actually maximize the output from our existing lines, by laser focus on efficiency improvement. As always, maintaining a high quality and the reducing per unit cost will be as critical as growing the production volume. For Mexico, we\u2019re working on infrastructure and factory design in parallel with the engineering and development of the new production that we\u2019ll be manufacturing there. That\u2019s what I can share for now.\nElon Musk: In Mexico we\u2019re laying the groundwork to begin construction and doing all the long lead items. But I think we want to just get a sense for what the global economy is like before we go full tilt on the Mexico factory. I\u2019m worried about the high interest rate environment that we\u2019re in. I just can\u2019t emphasize this enough that the vast majority of people buying a car is about the monthly payment. And as interest rates rise, the proportion of that monthly payment that is interest increases naturally. So, if interest rates remain high or if they go even higher, it\u2019s that much harder for people to buy the car, they simply cannot afford it. And we are tracking, I believe at this point for Model Y to be the best selling car on earth, but not just in revenue, but in unit volume. If you compare that to the other vehicles that are number two and number three and whatnot, they cost much less than our car. So, we\u2019re just hitting law of large numbers situations here. I know people want to us advertising, we are advertising. I think there\u2019s something to be gained on the advertising front. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s nothing. But informing people of a car that is great, but they cannot afford doesn\u2019t really help. So that is really the thing that must be solved is to make the car affordable or the average person cannot buy it for any amount of money or they can\u2019t afford it. So, this is big deal.\nMartin Viecha: The next question is, when do you expect Model 3 Highland to be available in the U.S.? I just wanted to address that unfortunately we don\u2019t answer product related questions and timings on earnings calls. So let\u2019s go to the next one. Current sell side consensus assumes that Tesla will deliver 2.3 million vehicles in 2024, representing 28% growth versus 2023 guidance. Is this growth rate achievable without any mass market launches in 2024? And when does Tesla expect to return to its 50% long-term CAGR?\nVaibhav Taneja: When we look at 2024, there are a lot of moving pieces. I just talked about what is happening in the macroeconomic environment. So, we\u2019re focused on growing our volumes in a very cost efficient manner and are carefully reviewing all our options, and we\u2019ll be able to provide a much more meaningful update at our next earnings call.\nElon Musk: Yes. I mean, at the risk of stating the obvious, it is not possible to have a compound growth rate of 50% forever, or you will exceed the mass of the known universe. I think we will grow very rapidly, much faster than any other car company on earth by far.\nMartin Viecha: Thank you. Next question is do you have an approximate timeline in mind for the robotaxi driven or non-driven? What excites you most about how this project is progressing?\nElon Musk: Well, robotaxi is like necessarily non-driven. I guess, I\u2019m very excited about our progress with autonomy, the end-to-end, nothing but nets self-driving software is amazing. It drives me all around Austin with no interventions. So, it\u2019s clearly the right move. So, it\u2019s really pretty amazing. And obviously, that same software and approach will enable Optimus to do useful things and enable Optimus to learn how to do things simply by looking. So extremely exciting in the long term. As I mentioned before, given that economic output is a number of people times productivity, if you no longer have a constraint on people, effectively, you\u2019ve got a humanoid robot that can do as much as you\u2019d like, your economy is wisely infinite or infinite for all intents and purposes. So, I don\u2019t think anyone is going to do it better than Tesla, not by a long shot. Boston Dynamics is impressive, but their robot lacks a brain or like the Wizard of Oz, whatever. Yes, lacks a brain. And then you also need to be able to design the humanoid robot in such a way that it can be mass manufactured. And then at some point, the robots will manufacture the robots. Now obviously, we need to make sure that it\u2019s a good place for humans in that future. We do not create some variance of the terminator outcome. So, we\u2019re going to put a lot of effort into localized control of the humanoid robot. So basically, anyone will be able to shut it off locally, and you can\u2019t change that, even if you put -- like a software update, you can\u2019t change that. It has to be hard-coded.\nMartin Viecha: Thank you. The next question is, why was the price dropped on FSD if it is getting better and robotaxi is expected so soon?\nElon Musk: Well, we just wanted to make it more affordable as more people try it. Yes, I think, over time, the price of FSD will increase proportionate to its value. So we regard the current price as a kind of a temporary low.\nMartin Viecha: The next question is again on FSD. Mercedes is accepting legal liability for when its Level 3 autonomous driving system drive pilot is active. Is Tesla planning to accept legal liability for FSD? And if so, when?\nElon Musk: Well, there\u2019s a lot of people that assume we have legal liability judging by the lawsuits. We\u2019re certainly not being let that off the hook on that front, whether we\u2019d like to or wouldn\u2019t like to do.\nUnidentified Company Representative: I mean I think it\u2019s important to remember for everyone that Mercedes\u2019 system is limited to roads in Nevada and some certain cities in California, doesn\u2019t work in the snow or the fog. It must have a lead car in plains, only 40 miles per hour. Our system is meant to be holistic and drive in any conditions, so we obviously have a much more capable approach. But with those kind of limitations, it\u2019s really not very useful.\nElon Musk: No, I think some people understand the profundity of the Tesla AI system. It\u2019s very, very few. It\u2019s basically Baby AGI. It has to understand reality in order to drive, Baby AGI.\nMartin Viecha: Thank you. The next question on Optimus. Will Optimus be working on Gigafactory lines next year? If so, how many would you guess will be deployed?\nElon Musk: I think at this point, we are not ready to discuss details of the Optimus program, but we will make -- provide periodic updates online. So, as you can see, we\u2019re -- Optimus a year ago could barely walk and now it can do yoga. So, a few years from now, it can probably do ballet.\nMartin Viecha: Sounds good. And the last question from investors is Neural net path planning represents a significant advance in capability and safety for FSD. What steps is Tesla taking to make this technology available outside the U.S.?\nElon Musk: Yes. Our approach has been to try to get it -- like the more places we\u2019re trying to make it work, the harder the problem is. So, the reason we don\u2019t do it in all countries simultaneously is that it would take much longer to make it work anywhere at all. So, that\u2019s why it\u2019s currently just North America. And also for most parts of the world, you have to get approval before deploying things, whereas in the U.S., you can deploy things at risk or at least you take liability for what you\u2019re deploying. So, it\u2019s -- most countries require some sort of extensive approval program. So, we only want to go through that extensive approval program when we think it\u2019s kind of ready for prime time in that country. I apologize it\u2019s not in those countries, but we keep plenty of ways to make it better. And it really needs to drive such that it exceeds the -- even unsupervised, significantly exceeds the probability of entry of a human or significantly better, a lower probability of entry than a human by far. I think we\u2019re tracking to that point very quickly. Obviously, in the past, I\u2019ve been overly optimistic about this. The reason I\u2019ve been overly optimistic is that the progress tends to sort of look like a log curve, which is that you have kind of rapid initial improvements that if you were to extrapolate that rapid fairly linear rate of improvement, you get to self-driving quite quickly, but then the rate of improvement curves over logarithmically as such to asymptote. That\u2019s not happened several times. I would characterize our progress in real world AI as a series of stacked log curve. I think that\u2019s also true in other parts of AI, like LLMs and whatnot, a series of stacked log curves. Each log curve is higher than the last one. So if you keep stacking them, keep stacking logs, eventually get to FSD.\nMartin Viecha: Thank you. Let\u2019s now go to analyst questions. The first question comes from Will Stein from Truist.\nWill Stein: We learned earlier on the call, it sounds like you don\u2019t think the truck will ramp to significant volume until its third year of production. Should we have a similar anticipation for the ramp of the next-gen platform, or is there any reason that we should be maybe more optimistic or pessimistic about the ramp profile there?\nElon Musk: Yes. I mean, to be clear, it\u2019s not really the third year of production. It\u2019s kind of like the 18th month of production is roughly my guess. So, it\u2019s just that they happen -- it will happen -- is that the -- it starts this year, spans next year and gets to 2025. So technically, there are three calendar years in there, but there\u2019s actually only 18 months, not three years. I would be very disappointed if it took us -- and that would be shocking if it took us three years. But 18 months from initial deliveries to have -- to reach volume and reach prosperity with an immense -- I can\u2019t tell you how much the blood, sweat and tears level required to achieve that is just staggering. I have been through it many times. Then, here we go again.\nWill Stein: Similar path for the next-gen platform?\nUnidentified Company Representative: I mean, there\u2019s like unique complexity to Cybertruck.\nElon Musk: Yes. I mean Cybertruck is -- yes. I mean, we dug our own grave with Cybertruck. Nobody -- generally, everybody digs a grave better than themselves. And so it is -- Cybertruck\u2019s one of those special products that comes along only once in a long while. And special products that come along once in a long while are just incredibly difficult to bring to market, to reach volume, to be prosperous. It\u2019s fundamental to the nature of the newness. So now the sort of high-volume, low-cost smaller vehicle is actually much more conventional.\nUnidentified Company Representative: Yes. In terms of like the technologies we\u2019re putting into it, we didn\u2019t have to invent full hard stainless steel or have mega 9,000-ton castings or the largest hot stamping in the world or new [Technical Difficulty] are quite in the same way as the Cybertruck. I think it will be quite a fast ramp. As I was just saying, we\u2019re doing everything possible to simplify that vehicle in order to achieve a units per minute level that is unheard of in the auto industry.\nUnidentified Company Representative: I mean, the single location makes it easier to automate. It also makes it lower cost. Yes, that\u2019s intrinsically lower cost.\nElon Musk: Yes. Let\u2019s be clear, it will be cool, but it\u2019s utilitarian. It\u2019s not meant to be -- fill you with magic. It can get you from A to B. It will be still beautiful. But it\u2019s utility.\nUnidentified Company Representative: That\u2019s not 14 inches of [indiscernible] suspension.\nElon Musk: Yes. So I mean, the Cybertruck has a lot of bells and whistles.\nMartin Viecha: All right. Thank you very much. Let\u2019s go to Pierre Ferragu from New Street Research.\nPierre Ferragu: I have first like a follow-up question on FSD and pricing and adoption. So, I agree with you that as FSD improves, we should see its value increasing. But I guess, like the ultimate values of FSD, which is to be able to handle like a robotaxi is not going to necessarily interest everybody, and you have a bit of a degraded version that would be like a chauffeur service where the car drives by itself, but you still have to be in the car and around. And then there is like the hands-on -- eyes-on version of the service. And I guess, there should be like much lower cost, lower feature kind of variance of the service that could have a very large penetration on your installed base and more expensive one that would remain at a lower penetration level. So, I\u2019m just wondering if you\u2019re taking that -- and last but not least, like the simplest version of FSD available and are going to work from a technical perspective, probably before like the ultimate robotaxi version can work if ever. And so I\u2019m wondering how you take that into account and how you\u2019re thinking like the financial contribution of FSD over time and whether you could evolve your pricing along that kind of tiers to increase adoption.\nElon Musk: Yes. A fully autonomous vehicle, I think, Pierre, your -- sort of the economics of autonomous vehicle are truly astounding in a positive way. When you look at passenger vehicles today, they only get about 10 to 12 hours of usage per week. That\u2019s -- if you drive 1.5-hour a day on average, that\u2019s roughly 10 hours a week out of 168 hours. And then there\u2019s also you\u2019re going to have parking and insurance. You got to take care of the car. It\u2019s like there\u2019s a lot of overhead. So I mean, yes, it\u2019s like the economics of the system are just insanely positive given that the car -- like all of the cars we\u2019re making and have made for a while, we believe, are capable of full autonomy. So then if you\u2019re able to say increase the utility of that car by a factor of 5, which only means that you\u2019re -- it\u2019s being used for maybe 50 hours a week out of 168, so you still notice -- you\u2019re still assuming -- that still assumes less than 1/3 of the hours of the week is doing something useful. You\u2019ve increased the value of that by 5, but it still costs the same, like you have something -- then we\u2019re a hardware company with software margins.\nMartin Viecha: Pierre, do you have a follow-up?\nPierre Ferragu: Yes, I have actually a follow-up on different topic for you that I have if that\u2019s okay. It\u2019s about like your gross margin in the quarter. Could you give us a sense of like in how the gross margin evolved sequentially, how much was the impact of idle cost? How much was like the sequential benefit, I imagine, of production ramping at Berlin and Austin? And then I saw like this massive jump in energy storage, very strong positive surprise. So, if you can give us the background on that and tell us how we should think about that gross margin going forward.\nVaibhav Taneja: Thanks for the question. So, in terms of -- you have few different aspects of your question. So if I just look at from Q3 perspective, obviously, factory idle time had an impact. It did impact by -- and I won\u2019t give you the exact percentage, but it had a decent impact for the quarter. And when you look at the other pieces, which we are trying to do, we did see certain of our other factories ramping up pretty well, right? And they actually contributed pretty well to the margin for this quarter. In fact, one of the factories came pretty close to in terms of per unit cost to where we are for our other established factory, which is Fremont. So that was a positive in the quarter. When it comes to energy margins, Megapack deployment was the key driver there. And that product has done well. I mean, on the cost curve also, we\u2019ve been able to do a lot there. But I do want to caution that Megapack deployments are a bit lumpy. So yes, we had a great quarter this period. But depending upon where we are trying to deploy that product in different markets, you would see periods where there would be downward pressure on deployment because of us trying to get the product to that base way\u2026\nUnidentified Company Representative: Yes, product in transit. Yes.\nVaibhav Taneja: Yes.\nMartin Viecha: Okay. Thank you very much. Let\u2019s go to Rod Lache from Wolfe Research.\nRod Lache: Really nice to see the rate of vehicle cost improvement despite the downtime that you took. You\u2019ve taken now about $2,000 out of the average vehicle costs over the past year. Can you give us maybe a sense of the rate of improvement that you see from the changes that you alluded to, the factory changes you alluded to? Is there a way maybe to convey the speed of improvement on your existing product from here? And then related to that, can you share the timing of your next-gen -- the lower-priced product that you talked about earlier this year?\nVaibhav Taneja: Yes. So just in terms of product margins, there are lots of puts and takes when you look at this. There are certain things which we control, and there are certain things which we don\u2019t control. We get -- we expect that we\u2019ll get some benefits from our cost reduction efforts, which are all underway. So on the other hand, we just finished our factory upgrades late in Q3. Some of these factories are still in the early ramp phase in Q4. We\u2019re still not up to where we want those factories to be. So, they will impact in the near term. Plus, like Elon mentioned, we\u2019re going to be ramping Cybertruck, which is going to be another headwind, which we will be dealing with. On top of all that, there\u2019s overall uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment, which even makes it harder to predict precisely as to where we land. But yes, this is something which -- it\u2019s an evolving thing which we\u2019re observing every day and reacting to it on a daily basis.\nUnidentified Company Representative: I would just say that on the cost reduction efforts, like we are not -- we are unflagging in our pursuit of additional cost downs for 2024. We do have a good pipeline of them and work on both the engineering side and the factory operations side. And our intention is to like maintain or exceed the trend that you saw, trying as hard as we possibly can.\nRod Lache: The timing of the next-gen product, can you share that?\nElon Musk: Not at this time.\nRod Lache: Okay. And just as a follow-up, obviously, price is also a driver of demand, but that\u2019s obviously not happening in a vacuum. And you mentioned that -- I think you mentioned that at some point during this call that you\u2019re also maybe hitting the law of large numbers on some of your products. Can you just share how you\u2019re thinking about price elasticity just at this point in this macro environment? And any thoughts along those lines?\nElon Musk: I think that there\u2019s very significant price elasticity. I mean, to be totally frank, if our car costs the same as a RAV4, nobody would buy a RAV4 or at least they\u2019re very unlikely to. It\u2019s worth noting that a lot of these incentives, like the tax credit and whatnot, they\u2019re actually very difficult for the average person to access because they -- most people do not have $10,000 or even $7,500, burning a hole in their bank account. A lot of -- a large number of people are living paycheck to paycheck, and with a lot of debt. They\u2019ve got credit card debt, mortgage debt. So, that\u2019s reality for most people. It\u2019s sometimes difficult for people who are high income and I\u2019d say high to be like someone who\u2019s earning over $200,000 a year to understand what life is like for someone who is earning $50,000 or $60,000 or $70,000 a year, which is most people. So like for a lot of people, like this tax credit just -- they can\u2019t front $7,500 for 18 months or even 6 months to get -- for the tax credit, and they actually don\u2019t, in some case, even have that $7,500 in taxes. So, it\u2019s really just the best regard to people is how much money do they have to pay immediately and how much per month. That\u2019s it. I think you stop right there. And our car is still much more expensive than a RAV4 when you look at it that way.\nVaibhav Taneja: Now one other thing which I\u2019ll add, when you look at car buying in general, we\u2019re trying to get to the next set of EV adapters.\nElon Musk: Not an EV adapter. Just who wants a great car.\nVaibhav Taneja: Exactly.\nElon Musk: It\u2019s not -- so now you get things like -- honestly, I would say it\u2019s like -- somewhat correlates with why doesn\u2019t everyone work from home crowd. I\u2019m like -- I mean this is like some real Marie Antoinette vibes from people who say why is there no work from home. Like what about all the people that have to come to the factory and fill the cars or that all people that have to go to the restaurant and make your food and deliver your food. It\u2019s like what are you talking about, you -- I mean, how detached from reality does the work from home crowd have to be? While they take advantage of all those who do -- who cannot work from home. So, I mean, you have to say like why did I sleep in the factory so many times, because it mattered. So I just can\u2019t emphasize again how important cost is. It\u2019s not an optional thing for most people, it is a necessary thing. We have to make our cars more affordable that people can buy it. And I keep harping on this interest thing, but I mean it just raises the cost of the car. I mean, we\u2019re looking an internal analysis, which we think is more or less on track that when you look at the cost -- or the price reductions we\u2019ve made in, say, the Model Y and you compare that to how much people\u2019s monthly payment has risen due to interest rates, the price of the Model Y is almost unchanged.\nVaibhav Taneja: If you factor in the...\nElon Musk: Yes, which is what I\u2019m trying to say. The thing that matters is the monthly -- it\u2019s how much money do they have to put down and do they literally have that in their bank account or their check balance and then what is the monthly payment. And it doesn\u2019t matter how -- if that monthly payment is principal interest or whatever, it\u2019s just a number, and that number has to not cause their bank account to go negative. That\u2019s it. So going from near zero interest rates to kind of the current very high interest rates, the actual monthly payment is basically the same. It\u2019s just a bunch more of it is going to interest. And there are some incremental challenges beyond that, which is the difficulty of getting credit at all has increased. And so, the number of people who simply cannot get credit, period, even if they\u2019ve got a job and everything is solid, the banks are a little gun-shy on handing out credit given that a bunch of them kicked the bucket earlier this year.\nUnidentified Company Representative: There\u2019s also just fewer options, even if they planned out credit, there\u2019s fewer banks to go there.\nElon Musk: Digital banks still exist. Well, if your bank does not exist, you have to establish a relationship with a new bank. And so a lot of regional banks are died, and I mean even Credit Suisse, I mean, geez, that was a shocker. A 160-year-old-ish Swiss institution, it doesn\u2019t exist anymore. That\u2019s mind blowing. And I think there\u2019s still quite a few shoes to drop on the bad credit situation. I mean, commercial real estate obviously is in terrible shape. Credit card debt has been rising significantly. The credit card interest rates are usurious. It\u2019s over 20% interest rates, meaning like -- which over time is just it becomes obviously extremely punishing because if somebody\u2019s paying 20% interest on their credit cards, means they cannot pay them off. If you can\u2019t pay them off and you\u2019re still accruing interest of 20%, you\u2019re at best headed to a bad place.\nMartin Viecha: Thank you. Let\u2019s go to next question from George from Canaccord.\nGeorge Gianarikas: Just to focus on the cost per vehicle coming down in future quarters as you discussed in your written remarks. I\u2019m curious as to what the levers of that could be. Is it more scale, more factory utilization? Is it material cost reductions? Are there things like gigacasting? I mean, can you just kind of give us some data points to give us confidence if that\u2019s going to come down over time. And if I can sneak one in, please, there are press reports -- and I know how perilous it is to believe some of these. But, they say that you\u2019ve included radar as an option in some Model Ys in China. And I\u2019m just here to ask if that\u2019s true. And if so, why?\nElon Musk: We\u2019ve not included radar. We have radar as -- a Tesla designed radar is an experiment in Model S and X. That\u2019s it. We\u2019ll see whether that experiment is worth it, but there are no plans to integrate radar into 3 and Y. Just as humans drive well, and in fact, an excellent human driver can drive with amazing safety simply with their eyes, the car will far exceed the average human safety just with vision, far, far, far because, I mean, the car is looking at all directions all at once. We don\u2019t have eyes at the back of our head. And the computer never gets tired and never gets distracted, get drunk, hopefully. And so, radar is -- what really matters is how much does it affect the probability of an accident. And in order for the radar to be effective, you have to be able to do radar-only braking -- you have to do actions that are radar-only. Otherwise, you get this disambiguation problem between vision and radar. That\u2019s why we actually turned off the radar in cars historically that we had shipped, all 3 and Y used to have radar, but we turned it off because the radar actually generated more noise than signal. Now the Tesla designed radar is a high-resolution radar that has some potential to be useful, but the jury is still very much out on whether that is in fact the case.\nUnidentified Company Representative: On the cost question, I guess, from the vehicle side, like as Drew mentioned earlier, we are always trying to engineer our products to be cheaper to make and more efficient to make. That comes obviously on the engineering side as we come up with new innovations but as well on the supply chain side. With our partners, we work with them to automate some of their lines and move their bottlenecks and their high cost as well. On the logistics side, getting parts to the factory, it\u2019s not like a one thing that -- you have to check cost everywhere and we do it ruthlessly at all times.\nUnidentified Company Representative: Operations efficiency. All of the above.\nVaibhav Taneja: Yes. I would say there\u2019s a whole laundry list of things, which we are chasing. We internally call it the cost attack, where we\u2019re literally going line by line and saying how can we make it better. And it\u2019s a grind.\nElon Musk: It\u2019s a grind. It\u2019s like Game of Thrones but pennies. I mean first approximation, if you\u2019ve got a $40,000 car, and roughly 10,000 items in that car, that means each thing, on average, costs $4. So in order to get the cost down, say, by 10%, you have to get $0.40 out of each part on average. It is a game of pennies.\nUnidentified Company Representative: We play it.\nElon Musk: Willingly, yes. We\u2019ve done it many, many times. And even something as simple as like a sticker, like there\u2019s too many stickers internally in the car that nobody ever sees. There\u2019s something as simple as a QR code. You may think, well, putting a QR code on a part. Why don\u2019t just put them on there, it\u2019s like, well, are we actually going to use that QR code?\nUnidentified Company Representative: That\u2019s a penny.\nElon Musk: Yes, exactly. And then inevitably, sometimes the QR code doesn\u2019t go on properly or you can\u2019t read it properly, and it stops the line.\nUnidentified Company Representative: More than a penny.\nElon Musk: Yes, absolutely. So chipping away, with -- I mean it is trying to -- it does feel like digging a tunnel with a spoon at times.\nUnidentified Company Representative: Very much escaping prison.\nVaibhav Taneja: On top of it, like we said, we did some factory upgrades, so we expect volume to go up. That would also bring some savings from higher production. But then on the flip side, we\u2019re going to be ramping a new product like Cybertruck, which we talked about. So, yes, so those are the real puts and takes what we are working for.\nElon Musk: Yes. But there\u2019s not like some accidently some brick of gold that we go left in the car, unfortunately. And it\u2019s -- we\u2019re trying to be very rigorous about improving the quality and capability of the car because it\u2019s like any fool can reduce the cost of a car by making it worse and just deleting functionality and capability and that\u2019s how I call this sort of any fool -- like if you want to like lose weight and you\u2019d say, well, I need to lose over 15 pounds right away, well, you could chop your arm off, but then you\u2019re sitting with one arm. You\u2019re still fat. So sort of like yes, you actually have to eat less food and work out. That\u2019s the actual way. It\u2019s not super fun because food is delicious. And personally, I\u2019m not -- I don\u2019t love working out. I wish I did, but I don\u2019t. Unless moving the mouse consists of working out, in which case, I love moving the mouse.\nMartin Viecha: All right. Let\u2019s go to Colin Langan from Wells Fargo.\nColin Langan: You said in the commentary that you\u2019re not going full tilt on the plant in Mexico until there are signs that the economy is strong. Can you continue at a 50% CAGR without that plant? And where would that come from? And any color on what you mean sort of not going full tilt? Could that plant get delayed indefinitely, or what are you are kind of talking about?\nElon Musk: No, we\u2019re definitely making the factory in Mexico. We feel very good about that. We put a lot of effort into looking at different locations, and we feel very good about that location, and we are going to build a factory there, and it\u2019s going to be great. The question is really just one of timing. And there\u2019s going to be a broken record on the interest front. It\u2019s just the interest rates have to come down. Like, if interest rates keep rising, you just fundamentally reduce affordability. It is just the same as increasing the price of the car. So I just don\u2019t have visibility into it. If you can tell me what the interest rates are, I can tell you when we should build the factory. We\u2019re going to build it. And I mean think we\u2019ll start the initial phases of construction next year. But I am still somewhat scarred by 2009 when General Motors and Chrysler went bankrupt. While that\u2019s now 14 years ago, it\u2019s -- that is seared into my mind with a branding iron because Tesla was just hanging on by a thread during that entire time and with -- I mean, we closed a financing round in 2008 at 6 p.m. December 24th, Christmas Eve. And if we had not closed that financing round, we would have bounced payroll two days after Christmas. So we actually closed that around the last hour, the last day that it was possible, stressful to say the least, and then barely made it through 2009. So, I\u2019m like -- I want to just -- I don\u2019t want to be going at top speed into uncertainty. A lot of wars going on in the world obviously as well, so -- and we have room here.\nUnidentified Company Representative: Like in Giga Texas. You said we still have room in this building. It\u2019s not full with Cybertruck and the line. There\u2019s plenty of growth opportunities still to have inside the building where our team already is.\nElon Musk: We also have 2,000 acres here.\nUnidentified Company Representative: There\u2019s also\u2026\nElon Musk: We\u2019re actually only occupying a tiny corner of the land that we have. We could technically do all the scaling, research just here. So, personnel is our biggest challenge and the greater Austin area only has -- generously the greater Austin area only has 2 million people. So people are moving here and they\u2019re willing to move here, but there is somewhat of a housing crisis. They got to live somewhere. So I don\u2019t know. I mean, I\u2019m just curious. Like I just -- I\u2019m not saying things will be bad. I\u2019m just saying they might be. And I think like Tesla is an incredibly capable ship, but we need to make sure like as -- if the macroeconomic conditions are stormy, even if the best ship is still going to have tough times, the weaker ships will sink. We\u2019re not going to sink. But even a great ship in a storm has challenges. Now that storm will apply to everyone, not just to us and not just to auto industry. It will apply to everyone, I think. So apart from necessary sort of staples, like food and stuff. So I just -- I don\u2019t know. If interest rates start coming down, we will accelerate.\nMartin Viecha: All right.\nElon Musk: If anybody\u2019s got any guesses on this, I\u2019d love to be less wrong. And I apologize if I\u2019m perhaps more paranoid than I should be because that might also be the case because I am -- I have PTSD from 2009, big time. And in 2017 through 2019 were not a picnic either. That was very tough going. So the auto industry is also somewhat cyclic because people hesitate to buy a new car if there\u2019s uncertainty in the economy. So it\u2019s car companies do very well in good economic times, and they don\u2019t do as well in tough economic times. So, it\u2019s just -- whereas if somebody is selling bread, then I think that people still eat bread. Yes, we need bread. We need food all time. But new car, you don\u2019t have to have...\nVaibhav Taneja: Especially if there are wars going on and then that impacts your sentiment.\nElon Musk: Yes. I mean people are reading about wars all over the world. Buying a new car tends to not be front of mind.\nMartin Viecha: All right. Unfortunately, that\u2019s all the time we have today. Thank you very much for all of your good questions, and we\u2019ll see you again in three months. Thank you very much."}, {"symbol": "TSLA", "quarter": 2, "year": 2023, "date": "2023-07-19 21:33:10", "content": "Martin Viecha: Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Tesla\u2019s Second Quarter 2023 Q&A Webcast. My name is Martin Viecha, VP of Investor Relations. And I\u2019m joined today by Elon Musk, Zachary Kirkhorn, and a number of other executives. Our Q2 results were announced at about 3:00 pm Central Time in the update deck we published at the same link as this webcast. During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC. During the question-and-answer portion of today\u2019s call, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Please use the raise hand button to join the question queue. But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?\nElon Musk: Thank you, Martin. So, just a Q2 recap. In Q2 we achieved record vehicle production and deliveries, and record revenue of about $25 billion in a single quarter. And Model Y became the bestselling vehicle of any kind globally in Q1, surpassing the likes of Corolla and Golf. So, it was the number one vehicle of any kind, including vehicles that are sold at a far lower price. This is, I think, an incredible achievement by the Tesla team, and just a huge thank you to our customers for their support. And this came in spite of high interest rates and a lot of macro uncertainty. And nonetheless, we managed to achieve operating margin of about 10%. We continue to target 1.8 million vehicle deliveries this year. Although, we expect that Q3 production will be a little bit down because we\u2019ve got summer shutdowns to -- for a lot of factory upgrades. So, just probably a slight decrease in production in Q3 for sort of global factory upgrades. In the long-term, autonomy we think is going to just drive volume through the ceiling next level. And our sort of future robotaxi products -- dedicated robotaxi products we think have like quasi-infinite demand. The way we\u2019re going to manufacture robotaxi is, is also itself a revolution. So, it\u2019s revolutionary design made in a revolutionary way. It\u2019ll be by far the highest units per hour of any vehicle production ever. So, very excited about that. With respect to Autopilot and Dojo, in order to build autonomy, we also need to train our neural net with data from millions of vehicles. The more -- I mean, this has been proven over and over again. The more training data you have, the better the results. And, I mean, there are times where we see basically -- in a neural net, basically it\u2019s sort of at 1 million training examples, it barely works; at 2 million, it slightly works; at 3 million, it\u2019s like wow, okay, we\u2019re seeing something, but then you get like 10 million training examples, it\u2019s like -- it becomes incredible. So, there\u2019s just no substitute for a massive amount of data. And obviously, Tesla has more vehicles on the road that are collecting this data than all of the companies combined by, I think, maybe even an order of magnitude. So, I think we might have 90% of all -- or a very big number. So, the success in AI endeavors is a function of talent, sort of unique data and computing resources. And we have outstanding capabilities in all three arenas. And I really just don\u2019t know how anyone could do what we\u2019re doing, even if they had our software and had our computer, if they did not have the training data. So, speaking of which, our Dojo training computer is designed to significantly reduce the cost of neural net training. It is designed to -- it\u2019s somewhat optimized for the kind of training that we need, which is a video training. So, we just see that the need for neural net training -- again, talking -- speaking of quasi-infinite things, is just enormous. So, I think having -- we expect to use both, NVIDIA and Dojo, to be clear. But there\u2019s -- we just see demand for really vast training resources. And we think we may reach in-house neural net training capability of a 100 exaflops by the end of next year. So, to date, over 300 million miles have been driven using FSD beta. That 300 million mile number is going to seem small very quickly. It\u2019ll soon be billions of miles, then tens of billions of miles. And FSD will go from being as good as a human to then being vastly better than a human. We see a clear path to full self-driving being 10 times safer than the average human driver, so. And between Autopilot, Dojo computer, our inference hardware in the car, which we call sort of Hardware 3, 4, but it\u2019s really dedicated. It\u2019s a high efficiency inference computer that\u2019s in the car and our Optimus robot, Tesla\u2019s clearly at the cutting edge of AI development. With regard to our Cybertruck, we continue to build our release candidates of the Cybertruck on our final production line in Austin. I\u2019m actually here in Austin at the Gigafactory. This is the first truck that we\u2019re aware of that will have four doors over a six foot bed and will fit into a 20-foot garage. So, it\u2019s sort of biggest on the outside, but it\u2019s even bigger on the inside. So it\u2019s -- I think that\u2019s a -- one of the elements of good design is it should feel bigger on the inside than it looks on the outside. And this is no small car, but we really cared about the exterior dimensions of the Cybertruck down to the last millimeter. So just -- we try to get right in the middle of the Goldilocks zone, not too big, not too small and then really maximize the utility of the volume. And we can\u2019t wait to start delivering it later this year. Some other highlights. Our global Supercharging network now stands at over 50,000 -- roughly 50,000 connectors and over 5,000 locations. As I think a lot of people are aware, the Tesla Charging Standard, which we made open source and it\u2019s now called the North American Charging Standard. We\u2019re deeply honored that Ford, GM, Mercedes and many other OEMs have signed up to use our connector and gain access to our charging network. We strongly believe in helping other car companies to accelerate the EV revolution and just trying to do the right thing in general. So, that\u2019s the goal there. Then something I think, I want emphasize, like very strongly, this is a very important point is that Tesla -- just as with the North American Charging Standard, although we\u2019re not license -- in that case not licensing, we\u2019re just making it available, but we are very open to licensing our full self-driving software and hardware to other car companies. And we are already in discussions with -- early discussions with major OEM about using Tesla FSD. So, we\u2019re not trying to keep this to ourselves. We\u2019re more than happy to license it to others. And lastly, our new lithium refinery and cathode facility are progressing well. In conclusion, we continue to focus on making as many cars as we can, while maintaining healthy financials. Our artificial intelligence development is obviously entering a new era and we\u2019re incredibly excited about what\u2019s to come. Our other businesses such as Megapack, Supercharging service and whatnot, all started to become a meaningful contributor to overall profitability this quarter. And then lastly, I\u2019d just like to profusely thank all of our employees who are making a lot of extra effort during uncertain times. Thank you very much for your hard work and the impact you\u2019re making.\nMartin Viecha: Thank you very much, Elon. And I think Zach has some opening remarks as well.\nZachary Kirkhorn: Yes. Thanks Martin. As Elon mentioned, Q2 was another record quarter of production and deliveries, as well as records in profit for our energy and services and other businesses. Congratulations again to the Tesla team on the continued progress. As we navigate through a period of economic uncertainty, rising interest rates, volatility in consumer confidence and regulatory change, I want to comment on our financial approach. First, the single most important priority is to ensure we are continuing to invest heavily in the core technologies that will drive the long-term value of the business. This includes increasing spending on AI related technologies such as full self-driving, Optimus and Dojo, as well as new products such as Cybertruck, our next generation platform and the Semi, as evidenced by the continued growth in our R&D spend. This also includes continuing our investments in capacity expansion, not only in our vehicle factories, but also our Supercharging network, service, internal applications, and battery processes, as we continue with meaningful capital expenditures to lay this foundation for the future. Second, we continue to work towards our goals of maximizing volumes on both, our vehicle and energy business, but most importantly, doing so in a way that generates the capital to continue our pace of R&D and capital investments. This requires a strong focus on per unit COGS reductions in each of our key businesses, as well as working capital improvements on raw materials, work in process inventory and customer AR, all of which progressed appropriately in Q2. If we look specifically at our automotive business, our gross margin showed a modest reduction and remained healthy, despite action taken to further improve vehicle affordability early in the quarter. We recognized \u2013 we realized per unit cost improvements in nearly every category, including material cost and commodities, manufacturing costs and logistics, while also continuing to rapidly increase the build rate in our Austin and Berlin factories. For our energy business, we improved margins and gross profit driven by cost reductions and deal economics, particularly with Megapack. As a reminder, storage volumes are typically volatile sequentially based on the types of projects and their specific revenue recognition milestones. As we look forward to the rest of the year, I want to reiterate Elon\u2019s comments on Q3 volumes driven by planned downtimes for factory upgrades. These upgrades will also carry some amount of factory idle cost. However, we are working to minimize as much as possible. It\u2019s also important to keep in mind the uncertainty in the macro environment, which can impact our execution positively or negatively in the near term. Regardless, we continue to remain dynamic with a focus on fundamental efficiency and a long-term outlook. Congratulations again to everybody on a great quarter.\nA - Martin Viecha : Thank you very much, Zach. And let\u2019s go to investor questions. The first question on licensing FSD we\u2019ve already answered. So, let\u2019s go to the second one. The second question is, what is the status of 4680 cells? How far are you from the specs you laid out on Battery Day? When do you expect to achieve what you laid out on Battery Day?\nUnidentified Company Representative: Yes. First, I\u2019ll just start with a little bit of a production update. So, in Texas, 4680 cell production increased 80% Q2 over Q1, and the team surpassed 10 million production cells produced here in Texas. So, congrats to the team for that. Their focus on yield reduced our scrap bill by 40% quarter-over-quarter, and that resulted in a 25% reduction in cell COGS. Here in Texas, we\u2019re preparing to launch our Cybertruck cell, which is 10% higher energy density than current production. That was accomplished through process and mechanical design optimization. As we scale Cyber cell production through the end of the year and early next, we should be in a comfortable place on cost per cell. Against our battery energy density targets, the Cyber cell is at our expectations on a like-for-like electrochemistry basis. We\u2019re yet to integrate silicon or in-house cathode production, both reviewed on Battery Day, which do bring significant further energy density and cost improvements, but that is a topic for another day. Lastly, it is important to remember that most of what we focused on a Battery Day was the Tesla-engineered 4680 production system and the improvements we strove to achieve on equipment, factory density, capital cost and utility cost reduction, all of which we are realizing in our Texas scale up to date.\nMartin Viecha: Thank you very much. The next question is, can you talk more to the upcoming Tesla Energy products and how your thinking has evolved on the revenue model? Given Tesla\u2019s AI capabilities, how do you see the long-term mix between hardware margin and recurring software margin from Autobidder as this segment accelerates?\nUnidentified Company Representative: We can\u2019t comment on future product road map, but I can provide a quick energy Q2 update. Megapack continues to show strong demand globally with Lathrop ramping successfully to meet our contracted projects in 2023. As stated last quarter, Megapack margins are in a reasonable place, in line with our target \u2013 vehicle target margins. The second final assembly line at Lathrop is progressing on schedule, eventually doubling Lathrop capacity ahead of our full factory ramp in 2024. We have several exciting large projects in construction or nearing completion, including the KES project in Hawaii, the Riverina project in Australia, several products in California and one here at Gigafactory, Texas that we\u2019ll tour today, actually. We want to thank our customers, utilities and grid operators for trusting us with these projects. On the Autobidder question, we continue to grow Autobidder contracts in wholesale markets like Australia, Texas, UK and California with over 6 gigawatt hours under Tesla\u2019s dispatch next year. In the UK, our projects performed best in the industry in Q2. Autobidder does have software margins and is an enabler for hardware sales, but it\u2019s a relatively small contributor to revenues, given how much deployment growth on the Megapack hardware side is occurring. It\u2019s important to remember that these large projects \u2013 these large capital projects have lifetimes of 20 years of recurring revenues on an annualized basis relative to upfront CapEx are small. On the residential side, we have some fun things happening. We recently surpassed 0.5 million Powerwalls installed. Just this week, we are launching Charge on Solar, which allows Tesla Powerwall and vehicle customers to charge their vehicles using their excess solar and drive only on the sunshine that hits their roof. Yesterday, we began paying customers in Texas for participating in our virtual power plant to provide grid support to ERCOT. We expect these credits to lower our median customer\u2019s annual bill by a third and to increase these credits over time as ERCOT expands market access. And today, we are expanding Tesla electric enrollment to new Model 3 owners in Texas, followed by all Texas vehicle customers over the rest of the quarter. Unfortunately and somewhat similar to Tesla Insurance, bringing Tesla electric and BPP capabilities to our customers requires working through a fractured regulatory environment on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis. In the long run, the value of residential energy software and hardware will be driven by the level of market access that utilities, market operators and regulators permit. For Powerwall that\u2019s eligible to provide the full stack of energy services, like peaker capacity and system buffering, such as in Australia, we can more than double the value of ownership relative to a typical system today.\nMartin Viecha: Thank you very much. The next question is, could you quantify the benefits to COGS per unit from the IRA battery manufacturing incentives; and secondly, battery raw material declines year-to-date?\nZachary Kirkhorn: All right. I can take that. On the first part of the question for IRA manufacturing incentives, we provided previous guidance that we expect these to be for the course of this year in the range of $150 million to $250 million per quarter. We are staying within that boundary as we guided previously, so that was the case in Q2 as well. I will note, and I think we\u2019ve mentioned this before, that this includes a 50-50 sharing of credits for qualified cells from our long-term battery partner, Panasonic. On the commodity side, we are continuing to see improvements there, as we\u2019ve discussed previously. Lithium is the most notable improvement so far. I think I commented on this on the last call, because typically, we see this coming about a quarter before it actually is realized in our financials. And also just as a reminder, we\u2019re not fully exposed to the price of lithium. Our supply chain team has done a terrific job in partnership with another \u2013 a bunch of other companies to put in place some long-term agreements here, but we do have some exposure that moves up and down. We\u2019re also seeing benefits in aluminum and steel, which I think is great. Not as large as the lithium impacts, but they contribute nonetheless. So, if we add up the total impact of this in Q2 relative to prior quarter, it\u2019s about the same size and magnitude as the IRA benefits that we also received. Just to put this in context, as you look at COGS per unit sequentially from Q1 to Q2, I think there\u2019s two things to keep in mind there. The first is that our SX mix for deliveries increased quite a bit from Q1 to Q2. So, as you think about fundamental cost reductions, it\u2019s important to adjust for that. And then secondly, as we continue to work on reducing our Austin and Berlin cost, which we did quite a bit of that from Q1 to Q2, these factories are still slightly above Model Y production costs elsewhere. And in the quarter, our mix of Austin and Berlin related builds increased. And so, that\u2019s something to consider as you model out the impact on \u2013 from Q1 to Q2 in terms of COGS per unit. I do want to ask Karn if there\u2019s anything else on the commodity side or just more generally, you want to add here?\nKarn Budhiraj: Yes. As you mentioned, Zach, we\u2019ve naturally been a little bit hedged from the lithium position because of the long-term contracts we have in place. But we have seen reduction in pricing across the board for all commodities that specifically go into batteries such as nickel, cobalt and graphite. And the reductions in pricing translate into thousands of dollars when you look at it from a per-vehicle impact. We\u2019re taking advantage of the historically low commodity pricing and certainly [Indiscernible] to kind of extend some of those fixed price contracts through the end of the decade. So it\u2019s a playbook that we\u2019ll continue to kind of go back to as we look to the future.\nMartin Viecha: Thank you. The next question on FSD. Have you considered allowing FSD transferability as a lever to allow existing customers to upgrade to a new Tesla instead of being locked into an existing car due to the price of FSD?\nElon Musk: Yes. This is a question we get asked a lot. So, we\u2019re excited to announce that for Q3, we will be allowing transfer of FSD. This is a onetime amnesty. So, it needs to be -- you need to take advantage of it in Q3, but -- or at least place the order in Q3 within reasonable delivery time frames. So yes, I hope this makes people happy. This is a onetime thing.\nMartin Viecha: Right. The next question, when will we give more information about the Cybertruck orders, estimated delivery schedules, pricing and specifications?\nElon Musk: Demand is so far off the hook, you can\u2019t even see the hook. So, that\u2019s really not an issue. I do want to emphasize that the Cybertruck has a lot of new technology in it, like a lot. It doesn\u2019t look like -- it doesn\u2019t look like any other vehicle because it is not like any other vehicle. So -- and the production ramp will move as fast as the slowest and least likely elements of the entire supply chain and internal production. So, I wouldn\u2019t expect -- I hope it\u2019s smooth. We\u2019re certainly better at production ramps that -- we\u2019ve got a lot of experience with the production ramps. But first order approximation, there\u2019s like 10,000 unique parts and processes in the Cybertruck. And if any one of -- it will go as fast as the least lucky, least well-executed element of the 10,000. So, it\u2019s always difficult to predict the ramp initially, but I think we\u2019ll be making them in high volume next year, and we will be delivering the car this year.\nMartin Viecha: Thank you. The next question is critics of Gigacasting contended that process makes vehicles harder and more costly to repair, essentially pushing costs on to the customer. Can you share some details about the initial repair experience with Gigacast vehicles?\nElon Musk: That must be why everyone\u2019s copying us.\nLars Moravy: Thanks, Elon. This is Lars. I mean, that\u2019s like simply not true. There\u2019s a misconception that traditional bodies are easy to repair, but they are made up of multiple materials and multiple joining methods. Spot welds and rivets have to be drilled out. Panels and structural adhesives have to be chiseled out. Dried adhesive has to be removed, stains, cut, blah, blah, blah.\nElon Musk: It\u2019s a crazy patch of a quilt.\nLars Moravy: Yes. And so putting that back together means time and money. Using an example of replacing a rear cast rail in the Model Y, to do that versus like what we replaced it with from Model 3, it\u2019s 10 times cheaper and 3 times faster to do it with the cast rail. Design team works with our collision repair team since we\u2019re a closed loop on this with insurance, and we design specific parts that make it easier and faster to repair. And we have an incentive to do that because we have our own insurance and our own body shops. We expect that we\u2019ll continue to do this, and collision repair will continue to become cheaper and faster over time. And we already make this available to all body shops or our Tesla-approved body shop training.\nElon Musk: Yes, closing loop on collision repair and factoring that into design is a big deal.\nLars Moravy: Crucial. I don\u2019t think anyone else can do it with that ecosystem that we have, so.\nElon Musk: Yes. And we are actually able to change the details of the casting with inserts, and we actually do that all the time, so -- because the inserts actually wear out and need to be replaced anyway. So we can actually make design changes to the inserts and tweak the castings. But the cast --basically cast rear body or front body is lighter, cheaper, better noise vibration, harshness, much easier to manufacture. It\u2019s better in every way. And that\u2019s why so many other car companies are copying us.\nLars Moravy: Probably.\nElon Musk: Well, they certainly put out a lot of press releases about it. I think it\u2019s basically going to be how all cars are made in the future.\nMartin Viecha: Thank you. Next question, how many Optimus bots have been made? And when will they be able to start performing useful tasks?\nElon Musk: 10 million. Yes. I think we\u2019re around 5 or 6 bots. I think -- there\u2019s -- we were -- look, 10, I guess. Depends on what -- how many are working and what phase. But it\u2019s sort of -- yes, there\u2019s more every month. There\u2019s a lot of interesting things about the Optimus bot. We found that there are actually no suppliers that can produce the actuators. There are no off-the-shelf actuators that work well for humanoid robot at any price.\nUnidentified Company Representative: Certainly not compelling.\nElon Musk: Yes. There\u2019s not a humanoid robot that can do something -- the things that human could do. So, we\u2019ve actually had to design our own actuators that integrate the motor or the power electronics, the controller, the sensors. And really, every one of them is custom designed. And then, of course, we\u2019ll be using the same inference hardware as the car. But we are, in designing these actuators, designing them for volume production. So, they\u2019re not just lighter, tighter and more capable than any other actuators wherever that exists in the world, but it\u2019s also actually manufacturable. So, we should be able to make them in volume. The first Optimus that is -- that will have all of the Tesla designed actuators, sort of production candidate actuators integrated and walking should be around November-ish. And then, we\u2019ll start ramping up after that. In terms of when we\u2019ll be able to do some useful things, like we\u2019ll first be trying this out in our own factories and just proving out its utility, but I think we\u2019ll be able to have it do something useful in our factories sometime next year. I would be -- yes, I\u2019m pretty confident of that. So yes, it\u2019s going well. I should say another cool thing about Optimus is that there\u2019s -- just in the U.S. alone, there are 2 million amputees. And I was just talking to the Neuralink team. And by combining a Neuralink implant and a robotic arm or leg for someone that has had their arm or leg or arms and legs amputated, we believe we can give basically a cyber body that is incredibly capable, $6 million man in real life, before don\u2019t want to cost $6 million. $60,000 man. This sounds impressive, but it will actually -- so that actually could be a really -- I think, would be incredible to potentially help people around the world and give them a robot arm or like that is as good, maybe long term better than a biological one.\nMartin Viecha: Thank you. The next question is, how has the order intake trended relatively to production levels during Q2? And how has it trended in the quarter-to-date period? Conceptually, how does Tesla decide when is it appropriate to reduce prices or at other sales incentives to increase demand?\nElon Musk: Yes. I guess, demand has roughly tracked production. So -- which is what we aim for is -- we look at -- it\u2019s something that we have that really -- I think no other carmaker has -- is that we have real-time demand and real-time production, like so seven days a week. I get an e-mail -- order generated e-mail, chose output from all factories and orders globally. So it\u2019s like a real-time finger on the pulse of earth basically. And we adjust course according to what the mood of the public is. Buying a new car is a big decision for vast majority of people. So, any time there\u2019s economic uncertainty, people generally pause on new car buying at least to see what happens. And then obviously, another challenge is the interest rate environment. As interest rates rise, the affordability of anything bought with debt decreases, so effectively increasing the price of the car. So when interest rates rise dramatically, we actually have to reduce the price of the car because the interest payments increase the price of the car. And this is -- at least up until recently, it was, I believe, the sharpest interest rate rise in history. So, we had to do something about that. If somebody\u2019s got a crystal ball for the global economy, I really appreciate it, if I could borrow that crystal ball.\nUnidentified Company Representative: DM us.\nElon Musk: Yes, exactly, DM me. It should be not on Twitter. So, I mean, one day, it seems like the world economy is falling apart and the next day, everything is fine. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. It\u2019d be totally fine. I wish I did. So, I mean that\u2019s why I say like I was on Twitter, I posted like just really advising because I care a lot about the sort of small shareholders, especially ones that have stuck with us through thick and thin. I love you, guys. And so, we can\u2019t control these macro shocks or the thematic depressive nature of the stock market. So, that\u2019s why I recommend against margin loans in times that are turbulent. If times are not that turbulent, actually margin loan can be a smart move within reason. But we\u2019re in, I would call it, turbulent times. Like I have very high confidence in the long-term value of Tesla. Like I see it -- I really see a path to a 10x -- call it a 5x increase in the value of the company, maybe a 10x. And -- but where things go along the way, the trials and tribulations and the mood of the markets, one cannot predict. And so, the old adage of buy and hold is right. For an investment advice, I\u2019d say like identifying a company as products you love. See if they -- does it seem like they\u2019ll continue to make good products or great products? Buy that stock and hold it. That\u2019s it. You\u2019ll win. The reason companies exist is to make goods and services, ideally great goods and services. They don\u2019t exist for any other reason. They shouldn\u2019t. So, that\u2019s why you should buy stock of a company that makes good products and has a great future pipeline. It\u2019s common sense, actually. And then generally, if you see -- if you provide your confidence about what that company\u2019s products or services are, when the market panics, buy; and when the market is overly exuberant, you can sell. I\u2019m not recommending you to Tesla, but yes, buy low, sell high. Warren Buffett actually, I think has a saying -- I\u2019m paraphrasing him, but a publicly traded company is like imagine living in your house and some crazy manic-depressive guy comes and stands outside your house and yells property prices at you, and it\u2019s a different price every day. But the house is still the same house. So, this is a stock market. Credit that to Warren Buffett.\nMartin Viecha: Thank you. Let\u2019s go to the next question. With the emphasis of price cuts to drive volume growth eating into automotive gross margin, can investors expect to see automotive gross margin stabilize or even rise due to efficiencies outpacing the cuts? And if so, when?\nElon Musk: Where\u2019s that crystal ball, again? If I may, look, the short-term variances in gross margin and profitability really are minor relative to the long-term picture. Autonomy will make all of these numbers look silly. I\u2019d recommend looking at ARK Invest. I think their analysis is very good. It\u2019s the best. And generally, Fintwit or the finance, Smart Finance people on Twitter, follow their accounts. They\u2019re great. So that\u2019s in my opinion where you\u2019ll get the best info. So, I strongly believe Tesla is a big long-term investment. And don\u2019t sweat when things go up and down. In fact, if the market panics, buy; if the market is a little too exuberant, sell at the time. But just generally, like -- I feel -- I\u2019m confident we\u2019ll deliver over long term, but can\u2019t control short term. So -- and the autonomy is really where it\u2019s at. I mean, Zachary?\nZachary Kirkhorn: I fully agree with you. I mean, I think the only thing in the short term that matters is what I said in my opening remarks, which is are we generating enough money to continue to invest. And the portfolio of products and technologies that the technical teams are investing in right now, this is intense. It\u2019s intense in terms of investment; it\u2019s intense in terms of potential.\nElon Musk: Frankly, I think it\u2019s ridiculous that we have positive free cash flow in a capital-intensive business, while investing massive amounts of money in new technology. That is super hard.\nUnidentified Company Representative: And vertical integration. It\u2019s not even just like new products, but also...\nElon Musk: Yes. We actually make our share...\nZachary Kirkhorn: And so, at least from my perspective, what matters is continuing to generate the cash to invest. That means continuing to be hyper focused on near-term cost reduction. Is everything we do in near-term cost reduction provides capital to reinvest? Hyper-focused on working capital management, which we\u2019ve made quite a bit of progress there on the raw materials and with -- a set of that we\u2019ve been very focused on accounts receivables as well to ensure that we can continue to reinvest the cash. This is what we\u2019re focused on. And so, there\u2019s a set of this that we control. We have a pipeline of cost reductions. We are getting tailwinds in the commodity space right now, as Karn mentioned, that\u2019s helpful. Variability around average selling prices goes back to Elon\u2019s point. We don\u2019t control interest rates. We don\u2019t control macro consumer sentiment. But we have an obligation to be responsive to that to ensure that we\u2019re matching supply and demand and keeping things balanced. And so, this is how we\u2019re managing the next handful of quarters. Soon enough, these quarters will be behind us. They won\u2019t be part of the present value of future cash flows of the business. And so, we want to make sure we keep that view and make sure that the long term business is exactly the way that we want it to be.\nMartin Viecha: All right. Thank you very much. Now let\u2019s go to analyst questions. The first question comes from Dan Levy from Barclays.\nDan Levy: I wanted to start first with a question about your efforts in AI and Dojo. It\u2019s pretty clear it sounds like you\u2019re accelerating your focus. Can you maybe provide us with a sense of what the process is of refining a product? Is it more machines? And maybe you could give us a sense of when the payout starts to -- when you start to see the payout and what the resource outlay is, what should we expect on the OpEx front as a result of this?\nElon Musk: Sorry. Are you saying how much are we going to spend on Dojo or\u2026?\nDan Levy: Yes.\nElon Musk: R&D on Dojo?\nDan Levy: Yes.\nElon Musk: Well, we\u2019re not going to be open loop on our Dojo expenditures. So -- but I mean, I think we will be spending something north of $1 billion over the next year on -- through the next year, it\u2019s well over $1 billion in Dojo. And yes, so I mean we\u2019ve got a truly staggering amount of video data to do training on. And this is another thing -- in order to copy us, you also need to spend billions of dollars on training compute. I mean, it\u2019s like -- and it\u2019s also hard to -- you need the data and you need the training computer. It\u2019s like -- think, well, things needed to actually achieve this at scale toward generalized solution for autonomy, it\u2019s -- this is one of the highest problems ever. You see a lot of AI companies doing LLMs and whatnot. I would say if they\u2019re so great, why can\u2019t they make a self-driving car? Because it\u2019s harder. That\u2019s why. So -- but I do think -- I think there\u2019s some great AI companies out there. But just fundamentally, the staggering amount of data we\u2019ve got to process, it\u2019s got to be processed somehow. And custom silicon is the best way to do that. So that\u2019s what Dojo is designed to do is optimize for video training. It\u2019s not optimized for LLMs. It\u2019s optimized for video training. With video training, you have a much higher ratio of compute-to-memory bandwidth, so -- whereas LLMs tends to be memory bandwidth choked. So that\u2019s it. I mean -- but like I said, we\u2019re also -- we have some -- we\u2019re using a lot of NVIDIA hardware. We\u2019ll continue to -- we\u2019ll actually take NVIDIA hardware as fast as NVIDIA will deliver it to us. Tremendous respect for Jensen and NVIDIA. They\u2019ve done an incredible job. And frankly, I don\u2019t know if they could deliver us enough GPUs, we might not need Dojo, but they can\u2019t. So they\u2019ve got so many customers. They\u2019ve been kind enough to nonetheless, prioritize some of our GPU orders. But yes, the sheer magnitude of video training -- because like I said, we\u2019re not trying to just get as good as human. We want to get to 10 times better than human, maybe 100 times better than human. Right now, I believe there\u2019s something on the order of 1 million automotive deaths per year. And then if you say permanent serious injuries, I think it\u2019s probably closer to 10 million per year. And -- so it matters if you\u2019re twice as good as human, 10 times -- like 10 times better than human would still mean 100,000 deaths and 1 million severe permanent injuries. So, it\u2019s like, okay, we would rather be 100 times better. So there\u2019s really -- it\u2019s a march of 9s, and we want to achieve as perfect safety as possible. And that\u2019s truly mind-boggling amounts of video and computer needed for that. And then, I do think there\u2019s other applications for Dojo, but we just desperately need it for video training.\nZachary Kirkhorn: Just to add to what Elon mentioned. So, the numbers that he mentioned are between R&D spend and capital spend. And this is moving quickly. And so, we provide a three-year outlook on our capital expense. We are considering these expenses in that outlook. And as that moves up and down, we\u2019ll continue to update our guidance in the Q.\nElon Musk: Yes. I want to say, the fundamental rate limiter on the progress of full self-driving is training. That\u2019s -- if we had more training compute, we would get it done faster. So that\u2019s it.\nZachary Kirkhorn: And it\u2019s just difficult to predict how quickly we can execute on it.\nDan Levy: Great. Thank you. Just as a follow-up, I recognize there\u2019s incredible macro uncertainty right now, but you\u2019re sticking with your near term, your volume target of 50% CAGR. As we just think about sort of in the year ahead, Cybertruck is going to be some contribution. There\u2019s going to be some help from further EV penetration growth. But to what extent are you willing to sacrifice on pricing to keep that 50% volume CAGR intact, or are you thinking differently about margins versus your prior commentary of willing to sacrifice on margins to get more share?\nElon Musk: It\u2019s not about getting more share. It\u2019s just that you can think of every car that we sell or produce that has full autonomy capability as actually something that in the future may be worth as much as 5 times what it is today. Because average -- vehicle is doing like maybe 10 hours of driving a week. If sort of -- if this says 1.5 hours a day on average, that\u2019s 10 hours a week-ish. If you\u2019ve got on autonomous -- if the vehicle is able to operate autonomously and use either dedicated autonomous or partially autonomous like Airbnb, like maybe sometimes you allow your car to be used by others. Sometimes you want to use it exclusively just like Airbnb -- doing Airbnb with a room in your house. The value is just tremendous. So, I think it\u2019s sort of, it would be -- I think it -- it does make sense to sacrifice margins in favor of making more vehicles because we think in the not too distant future, they will have a dramatic valuation increase. I think the Tesla fleet value increase at the point which we can upload full self-driving and is approved by regulators will be the single biggest step change in asset value maybe in history.\nMartin Viecha: Thank you. Let\u2019s go to the next analyst. The question comes from Emmanuel Rosner from Deutsche Bank.\nEmmanuel Rosner: Two questions from me as well. First, following up on the autonomy. So before you start launching these dedicated robotaxi vehicles, on existing vehicles, you\u2019re improving FSD incrementally. What is your latest targeted timing to essentially release a non-beta version or an eyes-off version that would trigger much higher take rates? And would Tesla benefit from lowering the price of FSD?\nElon Musk: Well, obviously, as people have sort of made fun of me and perhaps quite fairly have made fun of me, my predictions about achieving full self-driving have been optimistic in the past. The reason I\u2019ve been optimistic is -- it tends to look like is the -- we\u2019ll make rapid progress with a new version of FSD, but then it will curve over logarithmically. So first, logarithmic curve looks like just sort of fairly straight upward line, diagonally up. And so, if you extrapolate that, then you have a great thing. But then because it\u2019s actually logarithmic, it curves over, and then there have been a series of stacked logarithmic curves. Now, I\u2019m the boy who cried FSD, but I think we\u2019ll be better than human by the end of this year. That\u2019s not to say we\u2019re approved by regulators. And I\u2019m saying that would be in the U.S. because we\u2019ve got to focus on one market first. But I think we\u2019ll be better than human by the end of this year. I\u2019ve been wrong in the past, I may be wrong this time. And the price of FSD -- so the great thing is the price of FSD is actually very low, it\u2019s not high. When you go back to what I said earlier, the value of the car increases dramatically if it is actually autonomous. $15,000 is actually a low price, not a high price. And we will offer -- and we -- I think we do sort of offer FSD as a sort of monthly subscription, although most people don\u2019t know that. So, I\u2019d recommend like maybe trying it out as a monthly subscription so you don\u2019t have to go with the $15,000 thing. But I think yes, yes -- obviously, if the car is worth several times its original price, $15,000 is actually a low price for FSD.\nMartin Viecha: And the next question comes from William Stein from Truist.\nWilliam Stein: I\u2019d like to ask about -- to stick on this AI topic. We\u2019ve read with great interest the developments in Dojo today, and you\u2019ve spoken about FSD, but you\u2019ve also -- Elon, you started this x.ai company. And for investors that think that there might be quite a bit of value in the AI features and products of Tesla, it might be concerning to see you pursuing another endeavor where AI is the focus. So can you talk about how x.ai might overlap, might perhaps compete with Tesla or in other ways, perhaps it enhances the value of what Tesla does?\nElon Musk: Yes. I think it\u2019ll actually enhance the value of Tesla. There were just some of the world\u2019s best AI engineers and scientists that were willing to join a startup, but they were not willing to join a large sort of relatively established company like Tesla. So, it was like -- that\u2019s actually how it got started. I was interviewing a few people and they\u2019re like, no, we want to do a startup. I was like, and that\u2019s well -- I couldn\u2019t convince them to join Tesla. So -- so it\u2019s like, okay, well, better to start up that I run than go work somewhere else. That\u2019s kind of the genesis of xAI. And xAI is focused on sort of AGI. Yes. So it\u2019s -- like I said, I think there will be some value that xAI brings to Tesla. Also some of the best -- for the very best people in the world, they really just want to work on interesting problem. So if you take, say, a material science group, really what convinced Charlie Colman to leave Apple, where he was very happy and well compensated, and both at -- in both -- where we think is the best material science group in the world, was that he got to work at both Tesla and SpaceX. He wasn\u2019t willing to leave Apple if it was just Tesla, but he\u2019s willing to do it if it is Tesla and SpaceX. So sometimes you get the best talent in the world if that\u2019s the kind of thing you need to do. And that actually has been very beneficial to Tesla.\nWilliam Stein: If I could squeeze one more mundane question in. I wonder if you think you can hit the 1.8 million unit number with current pricing, or do you anticipate needing to continue to lower prices because it seems like they\u2019ve stabilized. The trends have stabilized in the last maybe 1.5 months. Should we expect sort of continued decreases or more stabilization for the rest of the year?\nElon Musk: Sure. We have sort of -- we started the referral program, which I think will be quite effective. As Zach was saying earlier, we don\u2019t control the macroeconomic conditions. So, if interest rates continue to rise, that reduces the affordability of cars. And for a lot of people, they\u2019re really -- they\u2019re just really breaking even every month. In fact, if you look at the rise in credit card debt, they are, in fact, not breaking even every month. Credit card debt is looking scary. So, we just don\u2019t control the market conditions. If market condition is stable, I think prices will be stable. If they\u2019re not stable, then we would have lower prices. Yes.\nMartin Viecha: Thank you. Let\u2019s go to Colin Rusch from Oppenheimer.\nColin Rusch: As you\u2019re building out Dojo and implementing what truly is going to be a highly complex set of software, can you speak to the maturity of the operating system and how much outsourced software you\u2019re expecting to use in that system?\nElon Musk: This is a custom software stack, so. But it is designed such that you can run at a high level, PyTorch and JAX. But then we have to customize it to actually run on a custom silicon. So, the software stack is a combination of open source software and then Tesla software all the way to the bare silicon, which is the case for the inference computer in the car.\nColin Rusch: Okay. Thanks so much. That\u2019s super helpful. And then can you speak to how you\u2019re managing some of the geopolitical risks relative to your capacity expansion? Obviously, as you guys continue to grow at this rate, you\u2019re going to be putting some folks out of business. And there\u2019s going to be some impacts around regional economy. So, I just want to understand how you\u2019re thinking about that in terms of some of your CapEx plans and how you\u2019re managing some of those relationships with different countries and regions.\nElon Musk: Well, this is a period of unusual geopolitical risk. So, I think we\u2019re -- the best we can do is have factories in many parts of the world such that if things get difficult in one part of the world, we can still keep things going in the rest of the world.\nMartin Viecha: Thank you. The next question comes from Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs.\nMark Delaney: Tesla has been making progress reducing costs and did so again last quarter. Can you give an update on when you think automotive COGS per vehicle could be under the historical $36,000 per vehicle level? And what are the key puts and takes to get there?\nZachary Kirkhorn: This is -- I think I was asked this in the past. This is very difficult to forecast. There\u2019s a series of costs that we manage, the series of costs which we don\u2019t control. And so particularly on the commodity side, where labor costs go, et cetera, it\u2019s just hard to say.\nElon Musk: Yes. And we saw very inflationary -- like strong inflationary pressures for a while last year. And now -- which obviously makes it very difficult to reduce COGS. And now we\u2019re seeing what seems to be deflationary pressures, certainly deflationary -- deflation isn\u2019t pressure. But we\u2019re seeing commodity prices dropping as was mentioned, as Karn mentioned a moment ago. I mean, I don\u2019t know, what do you think? I mean, basically, the trends seem to be deflationary at the commodity level.\nKarn Budhiraj: Definitely. There\u2019s that. And then there\u2019s also the unit economics improve as volumes grow. That\u2019s the other thing we\u2019re seeing. As we\u2019re becoming a bigger and better part of a lot of suppliers, the economies of scale come into play. There\u2019s equipment depreciation that comes into play, equipment that was commissioned 5 to 7 years ago. That used to be a part of the piece price. That\u2019s completely amortized. So, we\u2019ll see situation where piece price comes down because that equipment contribution has gone away. And then just we continue to have this mentality of continuous improvement in terms of labor, reducing labor, improving automation, and just continue to get better at what we do. So we have seen -- I think every quarter, we have seen an improvement. Of course, the commodities spiked up and down. Just in general, the trend is towards being more efficient.\nZachary Kirkhorn: Yes, I\u2019m totally agreeing.\nElon Musk: Yes, lithium prices were absolutely insane there for a while.\nZachary Kirkhorn: Yes. And they\u2019re recovering now.\nKarn Budhiraj: Cobalt -- the way it used to be.\nZachary Kirkhorn: Yes. And we\u2019re still early in the ramp -- well, not early in the ramp, but early in the cost down curve of Austin and Berlin. And so, it takes time to work the cost out it. First, it\u2019s a focus on ramp -- ramp, it brings cost down...\nElon Musk: And quality costs\u2026\nZachary Kirkhorn: Yes. And then once that stabilizes, we can divert bandwidth to cost reduction. And so Austin and Berlin saw quite a decent amount of cost reduction on a fundamental basis from Q1 to Q2. We\u2019ll continue to do that work that will be helpful. And so we\u2019re just going to keep chipping away at it.\nUnidentified Company Representative: Packaging is a big element to that.\nElon Musk: Yes, logistics\u2026\nZachary Kirkhorn: Logistics is normalizing, which is great.\nUnidentified Company Representative: [Indiscernible] utilization, something that the team has been very focused on. So, every bit of it.\nZachary Kirkhorn: Yes, and it\u2019s hard...\nElon Musk: Logistics is underappreciated. Yes, so sold saying goes like valves and with tactics as one with logistics.\nUnidentified Company Representative: Yes. And we\u2019ve made tremendous improvements in cost in all fronts on expired costs. We have done pre-pandemic expired cost levels now, and our goal is to go further down.\nZachary Kirkhorn: Yes. So when we look at our progress from Q1 to Q2 on cost, the way that we look at internally, normalized for the impacts of mix shift with Austin and Berlin being a higher percentage of our mix, normalized for S and X being a higher percentage of our mix in Q2 versus Q1, the sequential cost reduction, it might be the largest we\u2019ve had in a while. So, I think it\u2019s great work on behalf of the Tesla team, and we just got to keep it up.\nElon Musk: Yes, it\u2019s a game of pennies. It\u2019s a Game of Thrones with pennies.\nMartin Viecha: Mark, do you have a follow-up question? I think you\u2019re muted.\nMark Delaney: Yes. Thank you very much for all the details on that. Maybe you could put a finer point on the downtime impact that you spoke about in your prepared comments in terms of production impact and then also to what extent there\u2019s a margin impact from those factory upgrades that you\u2019re planning this quarter?\nZachary Kirkhorn: Yes. The downtime -- we don\u2019t know exactly the number of cars impacted because kind of the way that we go into downtime windows for upgrades is we set aside a period of time, but then the team is challenged to go as quickly as possible so that we can get the factories up and running again and minimize that. It\u2019s not profound reduction. Hopefully, it\u2019s small.\nElon Musk: I think we\u2019re getting too much into the weeds here. I mean, like we\u2019re asking for a level of precision that is not possible to answer. So, let\u2019s move on.\nMartin Viecha: Yes. I think this is unfortunately all the time we have for today. So, we\u2019ll speak to you all in the next three months. Thank you very much.\nElon Musk: Thank you."}, {"symbol": "TSLA", "quarter": 1, "year": 2023, "date": "2023-04-19 18:54:06", "content": "Martin Viecha: Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Tesla's First Quarter 2023 Q&A Webcast. My name is Martin Viecha, VP of Investor Relations and I'm joined today by Elon Musk, Zachary Kirkhorn, and a number of other executives. Our Q1 results were announced at about 3:00 P.M. Central Time in the update deck we published at the same link as this webcast. During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC. During the question-and-answer portion of today\u2019s call, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Please use the raise hand button to join the question queue. But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?\nElon Musk: Thank you, Martin. So just a Q1 recap. Model Y became the best-selling vehicle of any kind in Europe and the best-selling non-pickup vehicle in the United States. And this is in spite of a lot of challenges in production and delivery. So it's a huge credit to the Tesla team for achieving these great results. The -- it is worth pointing out that the current macro environment remains uncertain. I don't think I'm telling anyone anything, I think people already know, especially with large purchases such as cars. And while we reduced prices considerably in early Q1, it's worth noting that our operating margin remains among the best in the industry. We've taken a view that pushing for higher volumes and a larger fleet is the right choice here versus a lower volume and higher margin. However, we expect our vehicles, over time, will be able to generate significant profit through autonomy. So we do believe we're like laying the groundwork here, and then it's better to ship a large number of cars at a lower margin, and subsequently, harvest that margin in the future as we perfect autonomy. This is an extremely important point. Let's see. Regarding the Cybertruck, we continue to build Alpha versions of the Cybertruck on our pilot line for testing purposes. It's a great product, and we're completing the installation of the volume production line at Giga Texas, and we're anticipating having delivery event, a great delivery event probably in Q3. As with all new products, it will follow an S curve, so production starts out slow and then accelerates. So the Cybertruck is no different. So it's -- there's [Indiscernible] amount of demand for the product, obviously. And it is my view, a fantastic product, a hall of famer. But as with all new products, it takes time to get the manufacturing line going. And this is really a very radical product. It's not made in the way that other cars are made. So with regard to Megapack, we're making great progress. Our energy storage deployment reached nearly 4 gigawatt hours in Q1. This is, by far, the strongest quarter ever. And this growth was achieved thanks to the ongoing ramp at our Mega factory in Lathrop, California. There's still some way to go to reach the [Indiscernible] rate of 40 gigawatt hours per year. And then we additionally announced the start of a new Mega factory in Shanghai. So we're -- as we've expected, the stationary storage growth actually will significantly exceed the vehicle growth. Regarding Autopilot and Full Self-Driving, we've now crossed over 150 million miles driven by Full Self-Driving beta, and this number is growing exponentially. We're -- I mean, this is a data advantage that really no one else has. Those who understand AI will understand the importance of data -- of training data and how fundamental that is to achieving an incredible outcome. So, yes, so we're also very focused on improving our neural net training capabilities as is one of the main limiting factors of achieving full autonomy. So, we're continuing to simultaneously make significant purchases of NVIDIA GPUs and also putting a lot of effort into Dojo, which we believe has the potential for an order of magnitude improvement in the cost of training. And it also -- Dojo also has the potential to become a sellable service that we would offer to other companies in the same way that Amazon Web Services offers web services, even though it started out as a bookstore. So, I really think that, yes, the Dojo potential is very significant. In conclusion, we're taking a view that we want to keep making and selling as many cars as we can. Despite this being an uncertain macro environment, this is a good time to increase our lead further, and we'll continue to invest in growth as fast as possible. Once again, I'd like to give a huge thanks to all Tesla employees worldwide who are doing an incredible job again. And yes, super appreciated.\nMartin Viecha: Thank you very much. And Zach has some remarks as well.\nZachary Kirkhorn: Thanks Martin. I want to start by congratulating the Tesla team for record vehicle production and deliveries. And I also want to congratulate our energy storage team for record volumes as well. There's three main points I want to make. First, automotive gross margin and operating margin reduced sequentially. But as Elon mentioned, these remain at healthy levels. In particular, automotive gross margin was impacted by a few factors since our discussion on the last earnings call, which include additional action taken in the second half of the quarter to improve vehicle pricing and one-time items, most notably warranty adjustments on older S and X vehicles as well as increased deferred revenue for certain Autopilot features as we transition technologies. Progress on vehicle cost reduction continued in Q1 with meaningful improvements on logistics and the beginnings of some commodity cost reductions starting to be realized. Per unit cost for Austin and Berlin improved as well, driven by record volumes. However, these factories still provide a margin headwind and will likely continue to do so until after we reach and stabilize at our intended volumes. Note that Q1 was our third quarter in our multi-quarter plan to move to a more regionally balanced mix of build and deliveries. As I've mentioned previously, this results in lower deliveries and production within a quarter due to a higher volume of cars in transit at the end of the quarter and has an associated impact on quarter-ending free cash flows. This was particularly prevalent in Q1 for S and X as we begin exporting cars for international deliveries. Second, our storage business is starting to take shape, and this is exciting to see after many years of investment and focus. This business is growing as a percentage of the businesses of the company's revenue and reached its highest level yet in Q1, driven by an increasing rate of deliveries for our Megapack products. We are also making progress on storage profitability, generating our highest gross profit yet in the quarter. Third, I want to reiterate the philosophy by which we're operating the business this year. Our approach is to grow volumes as quickly as possible in both our vehicle and energy businesses. We plan to continue to invest heavily into our future plans, which include the Cybertruck next-generation platform, in-house cell production, energy storage business and our autonomy and AI-enabled products. And we plan to do this while keeping the business financially healthy and industry leading. To accomplish this, we need to remain focused on cost efficiency and working capital and in particular, unwinding the strategic inventory buildup left over from the pandemic. I want to conclude by thanking the Tesla team again, as well as thanking our suppliers and our customers.\nA - Martin Viecha: Thank you very much. And let's go to investor questions on say.com. The first one is what is the process to make auto pricing adjustments? What variables do you consider? How frequently do you review pricing?\nZachary Kirkhorn: Do you want to take that, Elon, or do you want me to take that?\nElon Musk: My apologies. Sorry, I was on mute. Yeah, I think this is not something that we can really talk about. It's just -- we do our best to evaluate the production output, macroeconomic conditions, and we make a decision. But it's -- and unless there's something you'd like to add, Zach.\nZachary Kirkhorn: I think that's right. I mean, as a team, we review where we stand globally on a weekly basis and certainly, I can't get into the details of the reasons why certain decisions are made. But it is something that's very actively managed by a subset of the leadership team.\nMartin Viecha: Thank you. The second question is, do you still believe Tesla Energy will be bigger than auto? And when will you provide more formal guidance on Megapack and overall Tesla Energy?\nElon Musk: Yes, I should just clarify like bigger than auto from the standpoint of like total gigawatt hours deployed. So its possible automotive revenue may be higher, but gigawatt hours I think will be probably higher with stationary storage. If you just look at the -- what's needed to transition the world to a sustainable energy economy, there is more stationary energy storage needed than there is mobile energy storage. So -- and we are seeing growth of our stationary storage well in excess of automotive. So that is in line with expectations.\nZachary Kirkhorn: Yeah. And on the guidance part of the question, and maybe, Martin, we can combine this with the next question, which is on guidance for margins, just have a single comment there. I think we are -- we will get to the point where we, as a company, provide guidance on the storage business. I say storage is a combination of both the Megapack business and the Powerwall business. Relative to total revenues of the company, it's still fairly small. And the business has a lot of volatility currently, both in terms of volumes as well as financials just given the small volumes and diversification of the customer pool there. But as this business grows and smooths out, I don't think we're that far away from it. I think including these volumes on our day two production and deliveries release is something that we'll start doing and then we can talk more formally as a business about our expectations over the coming year. I think it will be a few more quarters before we get there.\nMartin Viecha: Thank you. The next question, as you said, was already answered, so let's go to the battery question.\nZachary Kirkhorn: Sorry. Just one other thing I wanted to mention on margin. While we're not providing specific guidance there, I mean, just to set expectations of where we think this business will go in terms of margins, probably generally in the ballpark of what we've seen historically on the vehicle business. We generally look to mid-20% gross margins for any program that we launch. And so we're not there yet on this business, but that's what we're working towards.\nElon Musk: We're hopeful to get there later this year, but that's not a promise. That's an aspiration.\nMartin Viecha: Thank you. The next question is, how well are 4680 cells meeting the expectations described on the Battery Day? How long will it be until the cells meet those goals? Drew?\nAndrew Baglino: Yeah. So on Battery Day, we established a cost-down road map through 2026 across five areas of effort. There was the cell design we discussed, anode and cathode materials, the structural pack concept, and the cell factory itself, and we've been making progress across all of these aspects since then. For the cell factory, the Texas 4680 factory are partway through building and commissioning and selling and operating will be 70% lower CapEx per gigawatt hour than typical cell factories when fully ramped, in line with what we described on Battery Day. And we're continuing to further pursue densification and investment reduction opportunities in future factory build-outs like in Nevada. On the cell design, we're in production with not only the first generation tablet cell we unveiled on Battery Day, but a second more manufactural version in Texas today. On the cathode materials side, we have a number of activities underway per the Battery Day road map. For lithium, our Corpus Christi Lithium refinery breaks ground this May. Our goal is to start commissioning portions of the facility before the end of the year. The refinery uses the sulfate-free spodumene refining process with reduced process costs, no acid or caustic reagents, lower embodied energy. It actually produces a beneficial byproduct that can be repurposed in construction materials. We discussed all of these concepts on Battery Day. Same with cathode precursor, we've successfully demonstrated lower process cost, zero waste water precursor process that we described on Battery Day at both lab and pilot scale and are in the detailed design phase for incorporating this technology into the front end of our Austin cathode facility. On cathode production, we are 50% equipment and 75% utilities installed at our new cathode building in Austin, with our goal to begin dry and wet commissioning this quarter and next quarter with a target to produce first material before the end of the year. Structural pack, we saw big improvements with pack manufacturing with the 4680 cell and the structural pack concept, 50% lower CapEx and 66% smaller factory for the same output in gigawatt hours per year. We do believe structural as a concept is a good one. It's simpler. We'll continue to structurally load the cells and use the pack as the floor of the vehicle while iterating the design to closer to B-level execution of this A-level architecture in future programs. And zooming out for the 4680 team, Q1 was all about cost and quality. We made significant improvements in both areas. Texas production increased 50% quarter-over-quarter through yields increased 12% and [Indiscernible] peak rate increased by 20% and through yields improved by 20%. Altogether, the team accomplished a 25% reduction in COGS over the quarter, and we are on track to achieve steady-state cost targets over the next 12 months. And going forward for the rest of the year, the priority, one, is yielding cost for the 4680 program as we steadily ramp production ahead of Cybertruck next year.\nMartin Viecha: Thank you very much. The next question is, what do you anticipate 2023 automotive gross margins ex credits will be at the company's current pricing levels?\nZachary Kirkhorn: Yes, I can start off on this one. This is a difficult environment to make a projection like this. There's a lot of macro uncertainty. There's also headwinds and tailwinds. And this is basically a question I think that's asking about viewpoint on where costs will go. And within costs, there's a set of costs in which we do control and a set of costs in which we're kind of subject to what's going on in the macro world. Within the bucket of things we control, most of the cost down that we're working on is around ramping our Austin factory, stabilizing that and then doing the cost optimization work once we get to our intended volumes there. And a part of the cost journey in the Austin factory is, as Drew mentioned, the 4680 cell, which is an input into our Austin COGS. And so, as the 4680 program improves over the course of the year on cost, as Drew mentioned, and then the non-cell portion of the factory improves and we see a pretty good trajectory in the Austin facility. A similar story exists in the Berlin factory. It does not have 4680 as an input, but for that factory, the journey to complete localization is still ongoing. And so, over the course of this year, as volume increases, more localization occurs, we do see a good path to cost reduction in the Berlin factory as well. In existing factories, we talk about this on every call, so I don't need to rehash it, but the expectation is that every existing factory improves all of their key metrics and we continue to see the progress there. There's also a handful of other costs in which we have influence, but the philosophy here is that, we're aggressively going across every cost bucket that we can. Within the world that we don't control, the two major costs there being logistics, which fortunately is moving in our favor, and I think our supply chain team has done a great job, both on logistics optimization and taking advantage of reduced spot rates where they can. So thank you to our supply chain team. And then there's the commodities world, which has been a huge pain point in our cost structure over the last, say, two years or so, and we're still kind of at the maximum of pain for commodities in our cost structure. It kind of maximize -- max down in the second half of last year. We did start to see, in Q1, a little bit of improvement. We think there'll be a little bit more improvement in Q2, but...\nElon Musk: Lithium has dropped a lot. It's worth mentioning that the price of lithium has dropped significantly.\nZachary Kirkhorn: Yes. And that's the piece that we expect to see more impact on in Q2. And, generally, as a company, we do expect commodity prices to come down and have a more meaningful impact in the second half of the year.\nElon Musk: Yes.\nZachary Kirkhorn: So this is our approach. How that nets out, I mean, just a lot of risk, and we'll have to see how the year progresses.\nMartin Viecha: Thank you. The next question is, how has global order intake tracked since the most recent round of price cuts?\nElon Musk: I think the overall thing we can say is that orders are in excess of production.\nMartin Viecha: Thank you. And maybe the last question from investors, can you give updated specs and pricing for Cybertruck and any new features that will make it to production?\nElon Musk: Well, I think we'll save that for the Cybertruck handover, which will hopefully be around the end of Q3 this year. And one thing I am confident of saying is that, it's an incredible product, it's a hall of famer, I think. And a product like this only comes once in a long while. So it will not be disappointed at all. It's amazing.\nMartin Viecha : Great. Thank you very much. And let's go to analyst questions. We'll start with Alex Potter from Piper Sandler. Alex, go ahead and unmute.\nAlex Potter: Can you hear me?\nMartin Viecha : Yes.\nElon Musk: Yes.\nAlex Potter: Okay. Perfect. So, first question was on Lathrop. Obviously, that's -- it's great to see the growth there. Just wondering when you think that facility might be closer to full utilization? Are you just sort of deliberately working your way up the S curve there? Demand, obviously, isn't the limitation. So what are what are the steps, I guess, to unlocking full utilization there?\nAndrew Baglino: Sure. There are some classic factory ramp aspects of what's going on in Lathrop. We actually had two phases of the CapEx there. We phased some of the general assembly parts of the facility. But in addition, we also have ramps with our suppliers that we are following, so both on the sell side and on the power electronics side. And we will see that unlock in the latter half of this year with both those inputs. So the overall facility was phased with the second phase of CapEx coming online towards the end of this year.\nAlex Potter: Okay. Great. And then I guess my second question is on your ability to serve other markets out of Shanghai. Obviously, the facility in Berlin should be opening up your ability to, I guess, allocate more vehicles to Southeast Asia, Australia, other areas. I'm just wondering what other regions do you think you're maybe not yet serving effectively? What are your timelines for addressing some of those gaps in your regional exposure? Thanks.\nElon Musk: Yes. That's a good question because there are still many parts of the world that we do not yet serve with respect to vehicles especially. So we do expect to open up new markets around the world. And while those markets are not necessarily individually gigantic, they do add up to add a whole bunch of markets. They do collectively sum up to something significant. So it's high time that Tesla operates its cars to the rest of the world, and that is something that we intend to do.\nMartin Viecha : Okay. Thank you very much. Let's go to the next analyst, George from Canaccord. Go ahead and unmute.\nGeorge Gianarikas: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering, first, if you could discuss your FSD take rates and whether you've seen any significant positive or negative change there? And also, given that you've reduced the prices for your vehicles, do you think you need to do that for FSD as well? Thanks.\nElon Musk: Well, I can kind of answer the details on the FSD take rate, but the -- it's a tricky pricing question, because the value of a car that is autonomous is enormous. So in a way, the price right now is an option value on an autonomous vehicle. And that value is -- that will ultimately be very significant. And it's really -- yes. I mean, for those that are using the FSD beta, I think you can see the improvements are really quite dramatic. There'll be a little bit of two steps forward, one step back between releases for those trying the beta. But the trend is very clearly towards full self-driving, towards full autonomy. And I hesitate to say this, but I think we'll do it this year. So that's what it looks like. Yes.\nGeorge Gianarikas: Thank you. Maybe on the dramatic change we've seen in EV-related commodity prices. Do you think it's a reflection of any recent overcapacity in mining and refining, or is that sort of a coincident indicator on global EV demand? And how do you expect those prices to kind of track over the next several quarters? Thank you.\nElon Musk: Man, I wish I had a crystal ball to answer your question. I don't know if we can provide a question that would -- with -- that would have any value really. I think we're in uncertain times. And if somebody got a crystal ball they can lend me, I'd really like to borrow it. But these are uncertain times. My guess is this it's economic to me whether for about a year or so. And then if we hold roughly 12 months and then -- but this is my guess. It's just pure speculation. Stormy weather for about 12 months and then provided there are no major geopolitical wildcards that show up, that things start getting sunny around spring next year.\nAndrew Baglino: The only thing I would say on the -- like EV materials markets. They're not all super liquid and some of them, for example, like less than -- like single-digit percentage of the market has actually traded on the spot market. And not only are they not super liquid, there's not -- like storage isn't particularly fast for all of materials. So like small mismatches in supply and demand drive, like large price wins, not really real price wins, but just like temporarily large price swings. So it's hard to read into those price wings. I don't know, Karn if you want to add anything.\nKarn Budhiraj: Yes. Well, this is Karn, by the way. We are seeing, as Elon mentioned, quite a bit of softening in the lithium carbonate market. This was -- six months ago, we were trading at like $85,000 a ton, and today's spot price is about 26%. So there's been a dramatic decrease in that. Of course, we were able to take advantage of low lithium pricing earlier on with fixed price contracts. And we find that this is going to be another opportunity -- opportune moment to basically extend that into the later half of the decade. But we -- at the quantities we're procuring, we're not as impacted by the spot market because we have those contracts in place, and we're just going to be going and doing more of that. The other thing that's happening is because of the price spike, a lot of the companies that are in this business are becoming more ambitious about finding more upstream resources and exploring locations in Africa as well as South America. So that's also helping the macro situation with pricing.\nElon Musk: Yes. But just on the lithium front, to emphasize, the choke point is more -- much more on refining capacity than it is on mining. The theme is actually -- is very common throughout the world, including in the US and really never -- it's just a very common element on earth, is lithium. So, it's much more a question of where is the refining capacity and can the refining capacity keep up? That's really what matters more than where is the lithium ore. It's everywhere basically. I think that same question also extends to refining of the cathode and to some degree, refining of the anode. And this is why we, at Tesla, we're building our lithium refinery capability at Corpus Christi and our cathode refinery outside Austin. It's worth noting, I hope other companies do the same thing. We will have, by far, the most lithium refining capability and the most cathode refining capability in North America, I think, probably more than everyone else combined by a lot. So, can other people please do those work? That would be great. We're begging you. We don't want to do it. Can someone please? Like instead of making a picture-sharing app, please, we're trying, lithium, mining and refining, heavy industry, come on.\nKarn Budhiraj: It's fun. It's actually fun.\nElon Musk: Yes, yes. Exactly. For real.\nZachary Kirkhorn: That's we're here, ready to buy.\nElon Musk: It's -- Tesla is not famous because we want to do it. We have a lot of fish to fry, obviously, but we're doing it because others aren't doing it, and we wish others would do it.\nMartin Viecha: Awesome. Thank you very much. Let's go to Emmanuel Rosner from Deutsche Bank.\nEmmanuel Rosner: Can you hear me?\nMartin Viecha: Yes, we can. Yes.\nEmmanuel Rosner: Perfect. Thank you so much for taking my questions. Maybe a first question for Elon, on your pricing strategy. So, if I understand your message, you're saying Tesla feels it's worth maximizing the volume, increasing the size of the fleet as fast as you can because you'll be able to monetize this over the life cycle of the vehicle. Could you be a little bit more specific around ways you would be able to monetize sort of like this existing fleet in the future. Obviously, I think autonomous seems to be a big piece of it, but my understanding was that robotaxi would probably be for the next-generation vehicle, not the existing ones. So, I guess in which ways would you monetize it?\nElon Musk: Sorry, the robotaxi terminology can be a bit confusing because that's sort of like a generic term for our next-generation vehicle. And we obviously are working on next-generation vehicle. That's going to be very compelling. This is just not the time to talk about it in details product. So, we internally call it robotaxi. But really, all of the vehicles that have Hardware 3, which is the vast majority of our fleet, we believe will achieve full autonomy. So, there will be a like a Model 3 or Model Y would be a robotaxi, a robotic taxi. So, yes, that's -- to the best of my knowledge that we believe the current hardware can achieve full autonomy.\nEmmanuel Rosner: Understood. And then maybe a question for Zach. Back on the automotive gross margins. So, I think, I guess, a few months ago, even after major price cuts, you felt pretty strongly that 20% automotive gross margin was still probably a reasonable floor. Obviously, the macro has gone worse and additional price cuts have happened. Is there anything else that has changed in terms of the outlook? Is it just the macro deteriorating? Is it the competitive landscape? Anything else that's sort of like makes you think differently around the full year? And is there a way, therefore, to frame a floor?\nZachary Kirkhorn: Yeah. About half of the miss against that previous conversation last quarter is attributed to adjustments we made in pricing in the second half of the quarter. I mean, I guess you could argue that that lowers the floor in a sense. We've also made pricing adjustments so far this quarter. So that brings it down further. About the other half of the miss in Q1 was attributed to things that are nonrecurring. So I mentioned these in my opening remarks. It's a warranty adjustment for cars that were previously produced but not part of the pedigree of cars we're building now and some autopilot-related deferrals as we make some technology changes here that this deferral should get recognized once some of the software catches up. So those two things are not repeating. So hopefully, that helps answer your question.\nElon Musk: Yeah. I mean there's really two macro factors that are tricky. The biggest being the interest rate. So if there's a very high Fed rate or interest rates are very high, that is -- every time the Fed raise the interest rates that's equivalent to increasing the price of a car. It makes the cars less affordable because people are able to buy cars as a function of what they can afford on a monthly basis. So that's -- so it's just almost directly equivalent to a price increase, is there any kind of interest rate increase. Then the other factor is whenever there is uncertainty in the economy, people will generally postpone new -- big, new capital purchases like a new car. This is a natural human reaction. So if people are reading about layoffs and whatnot in the press, they're like, well, they might be worried about -- they might be laid off. So then there'll be naturally a little more hesitant than they would otherwise be to buy a new car. Now this is just the nature of the auto industry. But there is -- there will be a trans amount of pent-up demand for new cars. So it goes through cycles.\nMartin Viecha: Thank you. Let's go to Ben Kallo from Baird. Ben go ahead and unmute.\nBen Kallo: Hey guys. When you talk about manifest supply, you talked about Dojo being a product that you can sell outside of Tesla. How do we rank all the things you have going on and then in the economic environment? I mean, like heat pumps and everything else you have going on versus investing in the vehicle business, or is that not the right way to look at it?\nElon Musk: I'm not sure I fully understand your question, but I'd look at Dojo as like kind of a long-shot bet, but if it's a long-shot bet that pays off, it will pay off in a very, very big way. But potentially, yeah, potentially in a very, very big way, Like in the multi-hundred billion dollar level. But I think it's like still put it in the long shot category, but long shot with a multi-hundred billion dollar potential outcome. And \u2013 so it's a bet worth making, but not one you can sort of say like or take it to the bank type of thing. Although, these days take it to the bank, it's maybe not as secure as it used to be. So obviously, big believes in heat pumps. And that is on all this that over time is to do a really good heat pump for homes and commercial offices and stuff. And we have the technology that's really good. But it's still \u2013 it's a back burner item. Our focus is very much on vehicles, autonomy, stationary storage, basically solving sustainable energy and solving autonomy, which would be like \u2013 solving autonomy, if we're able to have a fleet of several million vehicles that with a software update can be potentially worth several times their original value, that's \u2013 that will be \u2013 if that happens, that will be the \u2013 and I think it will happen, that will be the biggest asset value increase in history, I think.\nBen Kallo: Thank you. Moving to sort of pricing, but a lot of pundits talk about the pie and losing share or gaining share. But how do you guys look at pricing versus the EVs or price vehicles, or does that not come into the equation? Sorry to ask about pricing again. Thank you.\nElon Musk: No, it's really just like \u2013 every day, we get a daily real-time update of how many cars were ordered yesterday, how many cars were produced yesterday. We must have \u2013 if there's a company that's got more real-time data than Tesla \u2013 I'm not sure, there's any company on earth that has better real-time data than Tesla, except maybe SpaceX Starlink. So \u2013 because like we don't have to -- for the other car companies, they will make the cars, send them to the dealers then the dealers will sell the cars. And then it takes quite a long time for them to get the data back to actually figure out how many cars were sold. Whereas we know how many cars were ordered yesterday throughout the world. So our fingers on the pulse is real-time and does not have latency, whereas the other car companies have a lot of latency in their data. As does the government, the government has a lot of latency in their data. So we're just looking at and saying, okay, what does it take to achieve a clearing price for our vehicle production? And then we'll make a pricing change, and we see what happens immediately and adjust course. So we're adjusting course \u2013 and we're thinking about it literally every day, seven days a week. Every seven days, we collect that e-mail and so is the rest of the team. And we try to make the lease down decision that we can. And on balance, I think our decisions are pretty good. Sometimes they'll be down, but on average, they're, I think, better than the rest of the industry.\nZachary Kirkhorn: Just to add on the question about EV market share or ICE. This comes up a lot. I think a lot of the public debate is around this concept of EV market share. We don't look at it that way. I mean, we look at it as -- it's a car market and not the EV market. And actually, the mission of the company requires internal combustion engine cars to be switched over to electric vehicles. So that's what we pay attention to.\nElon Musk: Yes. I've said that last time, too. We got -- you guys got to stop looking at it as EV -- the EV market. Its how many cars are we selling, just start looking at it that way. All cars will be EVs. It's going to -- I've said this for a long time. We'll look back, I don't know, assuming civilization is still around in 20 years, we'll look back on internal combustion engine vehicles the same way we look back on external combustion engine vehicles, which is like the steam engine. A steam engine is an external combustion engine vehicle. And there's still a few around. They're kind of quirky and kind of cool collectors' items. That's how gasoline cars will be in the future.\nMartin Viecha: Thank you. Let's go to Colin Rusch from Oppenheimer. Colin, go ahead. Unmute please.\nColin Rusch: Thanks so much, guys. Can you talk a little bit about how much of the actual cost structure is variable on these vehicles? And if you could give us a range on pulse or minus the lithium cost within those contracted volumes that you're seeing?\nElon Musk: Well, I think -- again, we'd really love to have a crystal ball here, but we don't have it. Depending on what time scale you're looking at, most of the car is variable. So most cost is variable. So -- and probably, if I were to guess, I think we will see improved costs from suppliers, yes, I think we will -- that is our expectation.\nZachary Kirkhorn: And we're already starting to see that, Elon, I think you had mentioned before that we anticipated a crash in the lithium prices and some of that has flowed through by way of lithium carbonate reductions into battery cost. And the same thing will happen with lithium hydroxide. The length of the supply chain matters also because what we're talking about is very far upstream. So by the time it makes sense that battery that ends up in car. It will be several months. But beyond just the commodity pricing, as Zach mentioned earlier, we're also very focused on other metrics that make production very efficient. So, for example, detention and demurrage air expedites. I think our air expedites are down 90%. Detention and demurrage is down 93% from the peaks. That can be hundreds of thousands of dollars per vehicle. So we're sort of attacking all vectors and becoming very efficient.\nColin Rusch: Okay. And then, my follow-up is really around stationary storage demand on the utility scale. I mean, obviously, there's a gigantic queue for interconnection in the US. And can you talk about the volume of quotation you're seeing at this point around stationary storage for the renewables queue on a global basis? And how much of that is converting into actual sales?\nElon Musk: Drew, do you want to take that?\nAndrew Baglino: I mean -- yes, I don't -- that's also not exactly how we look at it, really. We're not like -- yes, we're not engaged in the interconnection queue. Like we're focused on ramping Megapack as quickly and efficiently as we can, and we have visibility into the pipelines of a variety of different renewable energy and just pure stationary storage developers and we also develop our own projects. And we're mostly just -- we're being selective in trying to pick the products, the projects that best fit our mission and our objectives.\nElon Musk : Yes. This -- again, this is not a product call, but we'll have something, I mean, this -- we're making improvements on many fronts, including Megapacks. So I think some of those improvements will improve the speed at which you can connect the Megapacks to the grid.\nMartin Viecha : Thank you. The next question is from Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs.\nMark Delaney : Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. Do you still see 2 million units as an upside case for volume this year? And is the gating factor for reaching 1.8 million or 2 million units in 2023 still supply chain, as was mentioned on your last conference call, or is it more about demand at this point?\nElon Musk : Well, if you have a crystal ball you can lend me back to the crystal ball situation. These are volatile times. From a production standpoint, if things go well, we've got a shot at 2 million vehicles this year. But that's an upside case. And we feel comfortable with 1.8 million. And we'll have to see how this year unfolds.\nMark Delaney : That's helpful. Thanks. And then the company had spoken at the Investor Day and then for the past conference calls about opening up its vehicle charging network. Can you speak to some of the feedback you've been getting from both Tesla owners and non-Tesla owners? And how the ramp of the charging network may progress from here? Thanks.\nElon Musk : Drew, do you want to take that?\nAndrew Baglino: Yes. So as you may have seen, we opened our first V4 post in Europe and our Magic Dock post in North America in Q1. I mean, that is indicative of the direction we're heading with universal compatibility for all vehicles no matter where the charge port is, et cetera, in all major markets, and we're going to continue to roll out those sort of improved offerings as we build new stations. We're always balancing like our ability to serve our own customers with our ability to serve new customers when doing that. I think we've been able to balance it rather well. For example, in Europe, 50% of all of our supercharging stations are open to all EVs, and we've been able to do that without any increase in wait times at all for anybody. So we're going to continue to take a similar approach as we do this in North America and China over the coming quarters.\nMartin Viecha : Okay. Thank you very much. Let's go to Rod Lache from Wolfe Research.\nRod Lache : Hi, everybody. I just wanted to first just follow-up on your comments in your letter about leveraging your cost position as others struggle with unit economics and also taking into account the lifetime revenue, actually in a way that most other automakers will never see just given your service network and supercharging and other attributes. Can you just maybe give us a sense of how far you'd be willing to take this? Are there brackets around the range of initial margin that you'd be comfortable with? And again, any color that you might provide on the updated range of margins that you'd expect in the auto business?\nElon Musk : I think we may have answered this question or tried to ask this question a few times. But it's difficult to say what the margin will be. It depends on what the macroeconomic environment is like. So for example, if the Fed were to lower the rates, that would be super helpful for demand. If they raise them, that just raises the interest costs that buyers have to pay for to buy a car. So it reduces affordability and therefore, reduces demand. So it's -- but if -- like if we look past, say, this year or like go sometime next year, middle of next year, so I think things are looking really -- I think, like I said, albeit if there's some major geopolitical wildcard that turns up. But in the absence of that, I think I would be very optimistic about middle of next year, end of next year.\nZachary Kirkhorn: Just to add to Elon's comments, just two other points. What's really important for us this year in addition to just managing the day-to-day of the business but is also investing in, as Elon mentioned, what 2024 and 2025 will look like. And so using the cash generated from the sale of products today and reinvesting that, this is very important for us. And I think that what happens to margins over the next couple of quarters that only matters in the context of what that means for our ability to reinvest into 2024 and 2025. And we have a lot of space before that becomes something that we have to revisit our investment plans. And so we're planning to keep the business healthy. But I just want to caution folks about reading too much into what happens over the near-term here because we're very focused as a company on making sure that when we exit this macroeconomic situation, this company is positioned in the best possible way.\nElon Musk: Yes, exactly.\nRod Lache: Just to elaborate on that point though, the revenue, the long-term lifetime revenue that you're targeting from each vehicle is massive. So if you took that to the extreme, it would seem that you'd be comfortable with a relatively low initial margin. Am I misinterpreting that, or is that exactly right?\nElon Musk: Correct. That's exactly right.\nRod Lache: Okay. And the -- normally, in a recession, when consumers feel less financially secure, actually price elasticity deteriorates. Just based on your pulse taking of the consumer, do you have a view on elasticity of demand?\nElon Musk: Well, I can't emphasize enough the whole -- just fundamental question of affordability. For most people, their ability to buy a car is a function of can they make monthly payment or not. And so like I said, if interest rates are really high, like they are right now, then in some cases, people can't get a loan at all. So it's -- I think probably banks are pretty -- not leaning forward in providing loans, I expect, these days. So that's -- like there is -- there is quite a powerful story here when you -- going back to something as alluded to a moment ago -- I mentioned a moment ago that Tesla is in a uniquely strong strategic position. Because we're the only ones making cars that technically, we could sell for zero profit for now and then yield actually tremendous economics in the future through autonomy, no one else can do that. I'm not sure how many people will appreciate the profundity of what I've just said, but it is extremely significant.\nMartin Viecha: Thank you. Let's go to Adam Jonas from Morgan Stanley.\nAdam Jonas: Hi everybody. So, first, Elon, good luck with tomorrow's launch of Boca Chica. Break a leg.\nElon Musk: Thanks. You can't have too much luck in the rocket business, that's for sure.\nAdam Jonas: Incredible. So, now that you've gotten another Twitter architecture kind of intimately well over the past six months, what can you tell Tesla stakeholders about how an X.com or Super App could be potentially accelerative to Tesla's business model?\nElon Musk: Well, I don't know. I guess it could make it potentially make it easier to buy cars. So, -- We've string somewhat off topic here because I think there's some benefit. I think probably there's some benefit, yes.\nAdam Jonas: I get it, Elon,. So just as a follow-up on manufacturing, you're a student of history. And you'll note that back in 1913, Henry Ford introduced the moving assembly line in Highland Park, Michigan. And the price of a Model T, which had already been undercutting cars around the time, fell another 70% or 80%, and hundreds of rival car companies went bust. I'm wondering if history is repeating itself here, Elon, and that the recent pattern of cuts with you is way ahead of the cost curve compared to competition? Is this -- it seems like it's a calculated strategy, not just in reaction to competition or changing supply demand in the market, but your -- could we catalyze some Darwinian forces in the EV market?\nElon Musk: Well, I mean, we're not trying to say, take pricing actions in order to be deliberately -- to deliberately undermine competitors or anything like that. We really don't think about competitors that much. We just look at, do people like our cars, how can we make the product better, can they afford our cars? And the sort of the things like improving service and whatnot. But actually, we do have this unique strategic advantage that we have -- we're making a car that if autonomy pans out and we think it will, where that asset is actually will be worth a hell a lot more in the future than it is now. So, it is taking to be possible to sell it at zero profit, but still have the net present value of future cash flows associated with that asset very significant.\nAndrew Baglino: And service and charging and insurance and all of these other ongoing revenue streams that other companies don't have.\nElon Musk: Yes.\nKarn Budhiraj: Certainly, we want all EVs to succeed, too. We just want to say that we're not like some malicious attacks to try to destroy everybody.\nElon Musk: Definitely not. We're like opening up superchargers. We've made our patents available for free. So, it's like -- we're trying to be helpful here. So we're not out to destroy competitors or anything like that. We're trying to help competitors, frankly, in any way we can.\nMartin Viecha: Thank you. Let's go to Dan Levy from Barclays.\nDan Levy: Hi. Good evening. Thank you. First question, you're ramping supply at Austin and Berlin. So I wanted to understand just how critical it is to further increase volume at those plants just to get the vertical integration benefits in the face of the market with some demand questions. And just broadly, should we -- I mean, historically, you've been operating at the pace at which your supply allows you to produce as opposed to gauging to demand. Should we generally expect that you're going to continue to produce at your -- whatever the max capacity that you're allowed within your supply constraints, regardless of what the broader economic environment is just to continue to get that volume out there?\nElon Musk: So that is -- yes, I mean, there could be like obviously a macro shock that is so severe that people just stop buying cars for some reason. But in the absence of that, we will continue to grow output at a rapid clip.\nDan Levy: Great. Thank you. And then just on the margins associated with Austin and Berlin. You mentioned Austin want to have the margin drag until you reach intended volumes. I don't know if you can disclose what those volumes are. And then maybe you could just remind us of what the margin profile of Austin and Berlin will look like versus Shanghai once you get the vertical integration benefits in place?\nElon Musk: Well, probably one have be quite as good as Shanghai. Shanhai is hard to -- has a very efficient cost structures, obviously, our lowest cost structure in the world. But we do expect to be -- make significant improvements in Austin and Berlin and continue to make improvements in Fremont as well. So...\nRoshan Thomas: For making improvements in North America & Berlin cost structures, we've increased -- this is Roshan by the way. We increased our localization efforts strategically. So that will then drive down our days on-hand requirements reducing tied up working capital. We've made 10% quarter-over-quarter improvement in days on-hand. So we'll continue that improve cost structure as supplier localization improves.\nMartin Viecha: Okay. Thank you very much. And our final question comes from Philippe Houchois from Jefferies.\nPhilippe Houchois: Yes, good evening, and thanks for taking the question. It's slightly longer term. I completely agree with your comments that we should look at Tesla in terms of auto market share and not EV market share. But I'm just wondering, as you build up the market share globally, is there a limit to the direct selling business model as you practice it? And should we think about -- going forward, you need to look into the agency or using importers to basically develop market share more smoothly, I guess, globally? And so in other words, is there kind of fell by date for the direct business model as you practice it today?\nZachary Kirkhorn: Seems to be working well so far because we hear different feedback from customers who miss the human interaction or unhappy with the service, and I'm just wondering if you're seeing some growth pains in there that would lead you to change. You're not seeing that?\nElon Musk: Well, I mean, there are -- since we're always going to have some growing pains where at times -- and it depends on which geography we're talking about where sometimes service is behind sales, sometimes it's ahead of sales. This is -- I mean, Telsa's growing, I believe, faster than any company in history that makes a large complex manufactured object. So these are \u2013 as you try to max \u2013 it's always difficult to match exponentials. So \u2013 but I think it is helpful to have the feedback loop with a service because that means we feel the pain of service, and then we can address the design to make the car need less service. And I think that gives us the right incentive structure, like because the best service is no service. The car doesn't break. And whereas if you have say a dealer network that is reliant upon services revenue, then you arguably have a misalignment of incentives where they're making money on service. But actually, we want to \u2013 the best thing for the consumer is the car doesn't need servicing so.\nPhilippe Houchois: Yeah. And then last one, if I can follow up. Have you worked out, I mean, for many of your traditional competitors, a fair amount of profits for them comes from selling spare parts and servicing, and you don't have that in your profit structure. And have you looked at the deficit you have compared to your peers?\nElon Musk: Yeah. Actually, this one -- assuming I could wax on about for a while because really, people didn't understand that the best short-selling argument against Tesla for the longest time was the fact that Tesla does not have an existing fleet and that the auto industry, the reason incumbents succeed and newcomers fail, the biggest reason is that the incumbents have a large fleet, and they're able to sell new cars at close to zero margin and then sell spare parts at a very high margin, sort of razors and blades type thing. And so the only way to actually succeed for a newcomer to succeed is to have a product that is so compelling that people are willing to pay a premium over the incumbent product. And in the absence of electrification and autonomy, I don't think a newcomer can succeed.\nMartin Viecha: Thank you very much, everyone. Unfortunately, that's all the time we have for this quarter. We'll see you again in three months from now. Thank you."}, {"symbol": "TSLA", "quarter": 4, "year": 2022, "date": "2023-01-25 19:33:01", "content": "Martin Viecha: Good afternoon everyone and welcome to Tesla's Fourth Quarter 2022 Q&A Webcast. My name is Martin Viecha, VP of Investor Relations and I'm joined today by Elon Musk, Zachary Kirkhorn and a number of other executives. Our Q4 results were announced at about 3:00 P.M. Central Time in the update deck we published at the same link as this webcast. During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC. During the Q&A session portion of today\u2019s call, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Please use the raise hand button to join the question queue.  But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?\nElon Musk: Thank you, Martin. So 2022 -- just going through the 2022 recap. It was a fantastic year for Tesla. It was our best year ever on every level. Team did an amazing job. It's an honor, of course, to work with such an incredibly talented group of people. So, in 2022, we delivered over 1.3 million cars and achieved a 17% operating margin, the highest among any volume carmaker, I think maybe among any carmaker. While doing so, we generated $12.5 billion in net income and $7.5 billion in free cash flow. Importantly, the Tesla team achieved these records, despite the fact that 2022 was an incredibly challenging year due to forced shutdowns, very high interest rates, and many delivery challenges. So, it's worth noting that all these records were in the phase of massive difficulties. [Indiscernible] credit to the team for achieving that. The most common question we've been getting from investors is about demand. Thus far -- so I want to put that concern to rest. Thus far in January, we've seen the strongest orders year-to-date than ever in our history. We currently are seeing orders at almost twice the rate of production. So it\u2019s hard to say that will continue twice the rate of production, but the orders are high. And we've actually raised the Model Y price a little bit in response to that. So, we don\u2019t -- we think demand will be good despite probably a contraction in the automotive market as a whole. So, basically, price really matters. I think there's just a vast number of people that wanted to buy a Tesla car, but can't afford it. And so these price changes really make a difference for the average consumer. It\u2019s sometimes for those -- for people who are well -- who have a lot of money, they sort of forget about how important affordability is. And it's always been our goal at Tesla to make cars that are affordable to as many people as possible, so I'm glad that we're able to do so. And yes, so I think it's a good thing, all things considered. We're also making very good progress on cost control and we're seeing the cost production in Berlin and Austin drop commensurate with the growth in production, as you'd expect, so yeah. With respect to Autopilot, as of now, we deployed full-self driving beta for city streets to roughly 400,000 customers in North America. This is a huge milestone for autonomy as FSD Beta is the only way any consumer can actually test the latest AI-powered autonomy. And we're currently at about 100 million miles of FSD outside of highways. And our published data shows that improvement in safety system -- stuttering here, safety statistics, it's very clear. So we would not have released the FSD Beta if the safety statistics were not excellent. Regarding batteries, production rate of 4680 cells reached 1,000 cars a week at the end of last year, and we're increasing capacity for 4680 cells by another 100 gigawatt-hours as announced at Giga Nevada yesterday. Our long-term goal is to get to well in excess of 1,000 gigawatt-hours of cells produced internally and continue to use the self cell providers. So to be clear, we will continue to use other cell providers. Just that the demand for lithium ion batteries is quasi-infinite and will be for quite some time. So we feel we can scale a lot faster using both suppliers and internally produced cells. And we've got an amazing plan for making the 4680 cell low-cost and high energy density. So, energy storage also saw record growth and that is continuing to accelerate. That's always worth remembering that the three pillars of a sustainable energy future are obviously electric vehicles, solar and wind, and then the third key item is stationary storage to store the energy from solar and wind because obviously, the sun doesn't shine all the time and the wind doesn't blow all the time. So you have those three things, you can convert all of it to a fully sustainable situation many times over, actually. So, I would like to just make it clear that there is a path to a fully sustainable future for humanity, and our goal at Tesla is to accelerate progress on that path as much as humanly possible. So yeah, so we were obviously ramping up Megapack production. And we expect it to grow at a rate quite a bit faster than our - the goal output. So in conclusion, we are taking a view that we want to keep making and selling as many cars as we can. We believe we can keep pushing for strong volume growth while retaining the industry's best operating margins. As we mentioned many times before, we want to be the best manufacturer. But really, manufacturing technology will be our most important long-term strength. And we'll talk more about our upcoming plans at the March 1st Investor Day. And lastly, I want to once again thank all of our employees for delivering another record-breaking year. Congratulations, guys.\nMartin Viecha: Thanks, Elon. And I think Zach has some opening remarks as well.\nZachary Kirkhorn: Yes. Thanks, Martin. So as Elon mentioned, 2022 was a terrific year for Tesla. I also want to congratulate the Tesla team and also say thank you to our suppliers for your support during quite a volatile year. On a full year basis: revenue increased over 50%, operating income doubled, free cash flows increased over 50%, and our margins remained industry-leading. Additionally, we continued to make progress on overhead efficiencies as non-GAAP OpEx as a percentage of revenue improved further. For Q4 specifically, sequential and annual margin was impacted by ASP reductions, as we are managing through COVID impacts in China, uncertainty around the consumer tax credit in the U.S., and a rising interest rate environment. Note that in 2022, rising interest rates alone had effectively increased the price of our cars in the U.S. by nearly 10%. Additionally, COGS per unit has increased on a year-over-year basis, driven primarily by three factors. First is raw materials and inflation led by lithium prices and discussed at length in previous calls. Second, we are working through the early ramp of inefficiencies of our Austin and Berlin and in-house cell production factories. Third, our vehicle mix over the last year has moved more heavily towards Model Y, which carries a slight cost premium to Model 3. Partially offsetting these impacts, we've continued to execute on Tesla controllable cost reductions, in line with the progress we've made in prior years. These improvements include our continued work to gradually move towards a regionally balanced build of vehicles. The Energy business had its strongest year yet across all metrics, led by steady improvement in both retail and commercial storage. While much work remains to grow this business and improve costs, we believe we are on a good trajectory. As we look towards 2023, we are moving forward aggressively leveraging our strength and cost. There are three key points I wanted to make here. First, on demand, as Elon mentioned, customer interest in our products remains high. Second, on cost reduction, we're holding steady on our plans to rapidly increase volume, while improving overhead efficiency, which is the most effective method to retain strength in our operating margins. In particular, we're accelerating improvements in our new factories in Austin, Berlin and in-house cells, where efficiencies are the highest. But we are attacking every other area of cost and unwinding cost increases created for multiple years of COVID-related instability. This includes logistics, expedites, accumulation of material buffers, part premiums, productivity and overheads as an example. As the world transitions from an inflationary to deflationary environment, we expect a strong partnership with our suppliers on this journey as well. In that, we've priced our products with a view towards a longer-term cost structure. Thus, there will be an impact on operating margin in the near term. However, we believe our margins will remain healthy and industry-leading over the course of the year. Third, we are continuing to ensure funding is prioritized for our long-term road map. This includes expanding in-house cell production, bringing Cybertruck to market, development of our next-generation vehicle platform, expansion of our manufacturing footprint and growth of the energy business. We're looking forward to discussing these plans in more detail on our Investor Day in a month. Thank you.\nA - Martin Viecha: Thank you very much, Zach. Let's now go to investor questions. The first question is, some analysts are claiming that Tesla orders, net of cancellations, came in at a rate less than half of production in the fourth quarter. This has raised demand concerns. Can you elaborate on order trends so far this year and how they compare to current production rates? I think\u2026\nElon Musk : We already answered that question.\nMartin Viecha: Yes, exactly.\nElon Musk : Demand far exceeds production, and we actually are making some small price increases as a result.\nMartin Viecha: Thank you. The second question is in a similar vein. What has the initial reaction been to global price reductions in early 1Q 2023, specifically in terms of order intake levels? We've answered that one as well. So let's go to the next one. The next investor question is, will Tesla be able to take full advantage of advanced manufacturing production credits for battery cells packs? So $3,700 per long-range Model 3 and Model Y, it's $45 a kilowatt-hour for autos and energy products and how much does Tesla expect to earn in the coming year from these credits?\nElon Musk: I'll say a little bit about it, then I think Zach will add some. Long term, we expect these -- the value of these credits to be very significant. You can do the math if we were to get anyone your 1,000 gigawatt-hours a year of production or even a few hundred gigawatt-hours, it's very significant. So -- but the credits do rely upon domestic manufacturing. And in the case of Panasonic domestic manufacturing, we're splitting the value of the credits. So it -- the value of credits this year will not be gigantic, but I think it could be gigantic -- we think it probably will be very significant in the future.\nZachary Kirkhorn: Yes, just to add and input some boundaries on what we're expecting in terms of impact to Tesla for this year. So different products, we think, will get different amounts of credit. The regulations here are still influx and there continues to be updates so this is just our best understanding at the moment. But we think on the order of $150 million to $250 million per quarter this year and growing over the course of the year as our volumes grow. And part of the work we're doing here, which is part of what this incentive package is trying to incentivize is, as Elon mentioned, to move more manufacturing onshore in the United States, which is Tesla's plans anyways. And so I think we're pretty well positioned over the coming years to take advantage of this. But then also part of what the goal of this incentive package is, is to improve adoption from our customers. And so we also want to use these incentives to improve affordability as we think about what the price points are in our products going forward. And so as we're thinking about our pricing changes in the US, a couple of weeks ago that we announced, we were looking at what the credit benefit to Tesla would be to make sure that customers are able to receive the benefit not only from this that were received to some extent but also on the consumer-facing side, which is currently $7,500 per car of tax credit, assuming that -- subject to the MSRP caps and the income caps. So we want to use this to accelerate sustainable energy, which is our mission and also the goal of this bill.\nMartin Viecha: Thank you very much. The next question from investors is, after recent price cuts, analyst released expectations that Tesla automotive gross margin, excluding leasing and credits, will drop below 20% and average selling price around $47,000 across all models. Where do you see average selling price and gross margins after the price cuts?\nElon Musk: Yes, go ahead, Zach.\nZachary Kirkhorn: Yeah, I'll jump in on this. So there is certainly a lot of uncertainty about how the year will unfold, but I'll share what's in our current forecast for a moment. So based upon these metrics here, we believe that we'll be above both of the metrics that are stated in the question, so 20% automotive gross margin, excluding leases and rent credits and then $47,000 ASP across all models. And so two other comments I want to make on this. Just tactically on sequential ASP changes from Q4 to Q1. And just as a reminder, the ASP reduction is not as large as the reduction in configurator prices. As in Q4, we had backlog customers that we're delivering cars to at a lower price book, given that backlogs had been so long for so much of 2022. But then also, there are various programs in place that we used in Q4 that lowered ASPs. The second comment I wanted to make here is that as a management team here, we're most focused on what our operating margin is. And so as other areas of the business become more important, particularly the energy business, which is growing faster than the vehicle business and as we're heavily focused on operating leverage here, improving efficiency of our overheads, we think the right metric for us to be focused on is operating margin. And so I wanted to make sure that I shared that with the investor community as well, because that is what we're primarily managing to now.\nElon Musk: Yes. Something that I think some of these smart retail investors understand, but I think a lot of others maybe don't is that the -- every time we sell a car, it has the ability, just from uploading software to have full self-driving enabled and full self-driving is obviously getting better very rapidly. So that's actually a tremendous upside potential because all of those cars, with a few exceptions -- I mean, only a small percentage of cars don't have Hardware 3. So that means that there's millions of cars were full self-driving can be sold at essentially 100% gross margin. And the value of it grows as the autonomous capability grows. And then when it becomes fully autonomous, that is a value increase in the fleet. That might be the biggest asset value increase of anything in history. Yeah.\nMartin Viecha: Thank you. Let's go to the next investor question. Since Elon started political influencing, polls from Morning Consult and YouGov show\u2026\nElon Musk: YouGov, crush that with your left.\nMartin Viecha: \u2026show Tesla brand favorability declining in 2022 and division among partisan lines. Such brand damage can impact demand. Does Tesla track favorability? And how will any brand image be mitigated?\nElon Musk: Well, let me check my Twitter account. Okay, so I've got 127 million followers. It continues to grow very rapidly. That suggests that I'm reasonably popular. It might not be popular the way with some people, but for the vast majority of people, my follow count speaks for itself. I'm the most interactive account, social media account, I think, maybe in the world, certainly on Twitter, and that's actually predated the Twitter acquisition. So I think Twitter is actually an incredibly powerful tool for driving demand for Tesla. And I would really encourage companies out there of all kinds, automotive or otherwise, to make more use of Twitter and to use their Twitter accounts in ways that are interesting and informative, entertaining, and it will help them drive sales just as it has with Tesla. So the net value of Twitter, apart from a few people are complaining, is gigantic, obviously.\nMartin Viecha: Thank you. Let's go to the next question. Please provide a detailed explanation of where you are on the 4680 ramp. What are the current roadblocks? And when do you expect to scale to 10,000 vehicles a year -- a week?\nAndrew Baglino: Yeah. Thanks, Martin. First, I just want to say congrats and thanks to the Tesla 4680 team for achieving 1,000 a week in Q4. It was no small feat. Definitely a result of more than a couple of years of hard work. As far as where we stand in Texas, one of four lines are in production, with the remaining three in stages of commissioning and install. Really, our 2023 goal as a 4680 team is to deliver a cost-effective ramp of 4680s well ahead of Cybertruck. Focus areas are dialing in and improving the quality of the high-volume supply mechanical parts and driving factory process yields up as much as possible. Between two of those things, if we had achieved those key goals, we'll be well set up to -- for a major 4680 year in 2024.\nMartin Viecha: Thank you. Next investor question is Elon said previously that FSD Hardware 4 will most likely come first in Cybertruck. Is that still the current plan? Do you expect there to be an upgrade path for Hardware 3 cars to Hardware 4?\nElon Musk: Yes, Cybertruck will have Hardware 4. And to be clear, for 2023, Cybertruck will not be a significant contributor to the bottom line but it will be into next year. So it's an incredible product. I can't wait to drive it personally. It will be the car that I drive every day. I actually just I'm wearing the T-shirt with this matched glass. And it's just one of those products that only comes along once in a while, and it's really special. So yeah, so with respect to upgrading cars on Hardware 3, I don't think that will be needed. Hardware 3 will not be as good as Hardware 4, but I'm confident that Hardware 3 will so far exceed the average -- the safety of the average human. So what we're aiming for is like how do we get ultimately to, let's say, for argument's sake if Hardware 3 can be, say, 200% or 300% safer than human, Hardware 4 might be 500% or 600%. It will be Hardware 5 beyond that. But what really matters is are we improving the average safety on the road. But it is the cost and difficulty of retrofitting Hardware 3 with Hardware 4 is quite significant. So it would not be, I think, economically feasible to do so.\nMartin Viecha: Thank you. The next question is for Zach. Zach, when do you think Tesla Insurance will become big enough revenue source to warrant providing more details in the financials of the business so investors can compare it to other insurance companies?\nZachary Kirkhorn: Yes. I think it's probably going to take some time before this business is large enough for specific financial disclosures. But I'm happy to provide an update on where we stand in the business. So, we're currently at a $300 million annual premium run rate as of the end of last year. We're growing 20% a quarter, so it's growing faster than the growth in our vehicle business. And in the states in which we're operating, on average, 17% of the customers in the states are using a Tesla Insurance product. And that number continues to tick up as we spend more time in markets. And we see most of the adoption occurring when folks take delivery of a new car, as they're setting up insurance for the first time as opposed to going back and switching when they already have insurance set up. So there's an inherent stickiness in the Insurance business.\nElon Musk: No, go ahead.\nZachary Kirkhorn: No, I was just going to say, just as a broader reminder on kind of the motivation for starting this business, it was to improve and still is to improve the total cost of ownership of our cars, given that we're seeing high premiums of insurance from third-party companies. And that remains our priority here. We'll obviously run this as a healthy business, but we want to make sure we keep our costs low and insurance stays affordable to our customers.\nElon Musk: Yes. And so there are two really important side benefit to our Tesla Insurance that are worth mentioning, one of which Zach alluded to, which is that, just by Tesla operating insurance for our cars at a competitive rate, that makes the other car insurance companies offer better rates for Teslas. So it has a bigger effect than you think because it improves total cost of insurance costs even when they don't use Tesla Insurance, because now the guy [ph] goes up to the world have to compete with Tesla and cannot charge outrageous insurance for Teslas. So it's great. So it has an amplified effect, very important. Then, it is also giving us a good feedback loop into minimizing the cost of repair of Teslas, for all Teslas worldwide, because we obviously want to minimize the cost of repairing at Tesla if it's in a collision and for Tesla Insurance. And previously, we didn't actually have good insight into that, because the other insurance companies would cover the cost. And actually, the cost in some cases, were unreasonably high. So we've actually adjusted the design of the car and made changes in the software of the car to minimize the cost of repair, obviously minimize -- first, the best repair is no repair, avoid the accident entirely, which since every Tesla comes with the most advanced active safety in the world, whether or not you buy full self-driving, you still get the intelligence of full self-driving or active safety, active collision prevention. So it's giving us this really good feedback before, again, reducing cost -- total cost of ownership and also just figuring out how to get -- if somebody's cars in an accident, most accidents are actually small. They're like a broken fender or scratched side of the car or something like, the vast majority of accidents. But we're actually solving how to get somebody's car repaired very quickly and efficiently and back in their hands. And like I said, those improvements actually apply then to old cars. And we're making just to emphasize another key point, because some of these points might be like, so I apologize for being repetitive. But it's remarkable how small changes in design of the bumper and improving -- obviously improving the logistics of spare part or providing spare parts needed for collision repair, have an enormous effect on the repair cost. So, if you're waiting for a part to get repaired and that part takes a month, now you've got a month of having to rent another car. It's extremely expensive. And of course, you're missing the car that you love and the one you actually want to drive. So, this has actually a very significant effect on total cost of ownership and customer happiness.\nMartin Viecha: Thank you. The next question from investors is, is Cybertruck production still on track for mid-year?\nElon Musk: We do expect production to start, I don't know, maybe sometime this summer. But, I always like credit downplay at the start of production, because the start of production is always very slow. It increases exponentially, but it's always very slow at first. So I wouldn't put too much stock in start of production. It's kind of when does volume production actually happen, and that's next year.\nAndrew Baglino: Thank you. That's great Elon. Like just to emphasize on that, we've started installation of production equipment here in Giga Texas, castings, GA, general assembly, body shops. We built all our beta vehicles, some more coming still in the next month, but as you said the ramp will really come 2024.\nElon Musk: Yes, exactly.\nMartin Viecha: Thank you. And the last investor question is, with near-infinite global demand for energy storage.\nElon Musk: Yes.\nMartin Viecha: Where will Tesla build the next Megapack factories? How many are needed on each continent?\nElon Musk: It's a good question. It's not something we -- I think we'll provide an update about that in the future, but it is something we're thinking about very carefully. I really kind of like what is the fastest path to 1,000-gigawatt-hours a year of production. And you'll see announcements come out later this year and next, that answer that question.\nMartin Viecha: Thank you. Okay. And now let's go to analyst questions. The first analyst question comes from Rod Lache from Wolfe Research. And Rod, feel free to unmute your mic.\nRod Lache: I think I\u2019m unmuted. Can you hear me?\nMartin Viecha: Yes. We can.\nRod Lache: Okay. Thank you. Just firstly, it sounds like your 1.8 million unit volume indication for this year is somewhat more supply constrained than demand constrained. Then I have a follow-up on cost. Is that an accurate statement?\nElon Musk: Well, okay. I mean, our internal production potential is actually closer to two million vehicles, but we were saying 1.8 million, because -- I don't know, it just always seems to be some force majeure thing that happened somewhere on earth. And we don't control if there's like earthquakes, tsunamis, wars, pandemics, et cetera. So, if it's a smooth year, actually, without some big supply chain interruption or massive problem, we actually have the potential to do 2 million cars this year. We're not committing to that, but I'm just saying that's the potential. So \u2013 and I think there would be demand for that, too.\nRod Lache: Yeah. Thanks for clarifying that. And on the cost side, the numbers that we just saw from you, as you pointed out, were weighed down by the 4680 ramp, the Berlin, Austin, Giga castings, processes, not at rate. Can you give us a bit of an indication of the headwind that you're absorbing from those things like you did last quarter? And then lastly, on cost, do you think that we can tease out an interesting data point from on where battery costs are headed from this announcement that you just made last night? If I'm correct, it looks like the investment cost per kilowatt-hour is less than half of what I've seen anywhere else, maybe $30 a kilowatt-hour for that capacity?\nElon Musk: I don't think we want to say the specific number, but it's interesting, if you look at the size of the \u2013 of Giga Nevada that is allocated to make 100 gigawatt-hours, is a small fraction of the size that currently makes about 35.\nAndrew Baglino: Yes. I mean, the goals we've outlaid at Battery Day on using the investment required to deploy cell manufacturing, I mean, that's been a key focus of ours and the team is doing a good job hitting the marks on that focus.\nElon Musk: Yeah. And it goes back to the point, I was making. I said, it several years ago, I think Tesla's really the competitive strength that will be, by far, the hardest for other companies to replicate is Tesla being just damn good at manufacturing and having the most advanced manufacturing technology in the world. And if you've got that sort of advanced manufacturing toolbox, you can apply it to many things and we're applying it now to battery cells. I should also say that, there \u2013 we have other products in development. We're not going to announce them obviously, but they're very exciting. And I think we'll work for those clients when they \u2013 when we reveal them. Tesla has the most exciting product of any company on Earth by a long shot. And we'll continue to, I think, be in that position. We've got more great ideas. I mean, we know what to do with. So the future is very exciting. As I said in the last call, there's going to be bumps along the way and we'll probably have a pretty difficult recession this year, probably. I hope not, but probably. And so, one can't predict the short-term sort of stock value, because when there's a recession and people panic and the stock market then prices of stocks, worth value of stocks can drop sometimes to surprisingly low levels. But long term, I'm convinced that, Tesla will be the most valuable company on Earth.\nMartin Viecha: Thank you. And I think, Zach, there was a question on cost headwind in Q4.\nZachary Kirkhorn: Yeah. I mean, our weighted average COGS for the company, if you were to assume Austin and Berlin were at the cost structure of our other factories, it was on the order of 2,000 to 2,500 of headwinds. So I think from there, you can back into margin impact of those factories as of end of Q4.\nMartin Viecha: Thank you very much. And let's go to the next question from Pierre Ferragu from New Street Research.\nPierre Ferragu: Thanks, Martin. Can you hear me well?\nMartin Viecha: Yes.\nPierre Ferragu: Excellent. Zach, actually, I'd like to follow up on the data point you just gave on cost. If I look back at the COGS per car, you guys bottom close to $36,000 in the middle of 2021. And then the number went up as you had to face with inflation in input costs and the ramp of Berlin and Texas. And this quarter, I think we are close to $40,000 and we peaked maybe close to $42,000 at some point last year. And so my question from here is, how much time do you think it takes you to get back to this kind of $36,000, which would mean Berlin and Texas and those input costs, all that stuff is normalizing, is that like -- and that would be like a kind of like a 10% decline in the COGS per car? Is that something we can hope to see this year or is that too optimistic?\nZachary Kirkhorn: The Austin and Berlin ramp inefficiencies in 4680 will make a substantial amount of progress on that over the course of the year, and that's within Tesla's control. We're doing a lot of work on cost reduction outside of that. And we talked about supply chain costs, expedite, logistics, attacking everything. On the raw materials and inflation side, where lithium is the large driver there and this was a meaningful source of cost increase for us, we'll have to see where lithium prices go. And we're not fully exposed to lithium prices, but I think in general, is what we've seen from our forecast here, cost per car of lithium in 2023 will be higher than 2022. So that's a headwind that would have to be overcome to return back to those levels. So, I don't think we'll get there this year, but I think we'll make progress. And we'll continue to find ways to offset these raw material costs that we don't have control over. [Indiscernible] is there anything on that?\nRoshan Thomas: Yes. Like on the non-cells raw material, we begin to capture benefits of indexes tapering out, but due to the length of various supply chains, it does take time before this is reflected in our financials. And while alumina is down like 20% year-over-year, steel is about 30% down year-over-year, the global non-cells raw materials market continues to be influenced by geopolitical situations in Europe, high production cost due to labor cost increases and energy spikes and disruptions due to natural disasters like typhoon in Korea four months ago, pandemic lockdowns. So, we believe that meaningful price corrections will ultimately come, but it remains uncertain exactly when. In the meantime, we continue to redesign supply chain to make it more efficient and work with our supplier partners to find more efficiencies, streamline logistics and transportation to reduce costs.\nPierre Ferragu: Excellent. Thank you. And I\u2026\nMartin Viecha: Sorry, do you want to go say something?\nAndrew Baglino: I was going to say, we're also -- our fleet is starting to mature, the 3, Y fleet. And we're gathering a lot of data out of that fleet to understand how we can sort of bring some margin that we didn't know we had out of the product. So over the course of 2023 on the powertrain side, we're actually going to go after sort of some materials where we're paying for more performance than we need, or we have more content than we need, without impacting reliability at all. And that will actually add up to a pretty significant cost reduction on the powertrain side over the course of 2023. So we're not just sort of relying on supply. We're also doing design actions to bring cost out.\nElon Musk: Yes. My guess is, if there is -- if the recession is a serious one and I think it probably will be, but I hope it isn't, that would lead to meaningful decreases in almost all of our input costs. So we expect to see deflation in our input costs most likely, which would then lead to, yes, better margin. I'm just guessing here. So, this is -- that would be my guess.\nPierre Ferragu: Thank you, so much. So as a quick follow-up, Elon, I was thinking about like FSD, and when you look at like the situation today compared to a year ago, it's -- like the progress has been, like, amazing in the quality of the product, but also its rollout. And so, I was wondering, how much is this like impacting the take rate of FSD today? So do you already see that people are getting more excited by FSD, because they see it around them on 400,000 cars and they see the value of the service already, or is that too early to really see like, to expect like an uptick in the take rate?\nElon Musk: The trend is very strong towards use of FSD. And as you alluded to, with each incremental improvement, the enthusiasm obviously increases. And -- so, I think something that still a lot of people out there don't quite appreciate is that Tesla -- of course say like, Tesla is as much as a software company as a hardware company, but Tesla is really one of the world's leading AI companies. This is kind of a big deal with AI on the software side and on the hardware side. With the Hardware 3 inference computer, still the most efficient inference computer in the world despite being, at this point, five years old from the design point. And Hardware 4 coming and then Hardware 5 beyond that, where there are significant leaps. And the Dojo computer, we expect to be using that operationally at Tesla later this year. And we're seeing just a lot of world-class AI talent join the company. There's also the long-term potential of Optimus where we're able to use our expertise in electric motors and power electronics, batteries and advanced manufacturing to be able to make a humanoid robot that is actually useful and can be made at high volume with exceptional capabilities, because of the -- or robot AI that, where we take the -- because the car is like a robot on four wheels and Optimus is a robot on legs. But the -- as we get closer and closer to solving real-world AI, and we don't see anyone even close to us in achieving this, the value -- I think, you appreciate this and a few others do, but most don't know what I'm talking about. And so -- but it's -- this is the thing that has order of magnitude potential market cap improvement for Tesla.\nMartin Viecha: Thank you. And the next question comes from Alex Potter from Piper Sandler.\nAlex Potter: Can you hear me, guys?\nMartin Viecha: Yes.\nZachary Kirkhorn: Yes\nAlex Potter: Okay, great. So a quick one on FSD. This, I guess, for Zach. Obviously, you unlocked some deferred revenue in the quarter that will translate presumably into higher margins on every incremental sale going forward so long as people opt in for FSD. But was wondering if you're able to disclose the percentage of the $15,000 price that you're not going to be able to recognize as revenue upfront rather than deferred?\nZachary Kirkhorn: Yes. I mean, the way that we've structured this is a full self-driving package has two components. There's enhanced Autopilot, the price of which is listed on the website. We fully recognize that. Then there's an incremental, which is for the additional features of full self-driving offers and we've released a portion of that. And then there's a minority of the total package that's remaining that will be released over time as software updates are there. And in our shareholder letter, in addition to disclosing the dollar amount of the deferred revenue release, we also included in there the dollar value of the balance of unreleased deferred revenue that will be released over time with future software updates.\nAlex Potter: Okay, great. And then maybe 1 additional question here on the incremental capacity in Nevada, the 4680s that you're planning. That's a lot of batteries obviously, and presumably, you won't be putting all of those in Tesla Semi. So I guess, two questions about that incremental capacity. First, is it correct to assume that all of those 4680s are going to be more or less fungible and usable in your entire range of products? And if the answer is yes, then if you had to guess, how do you think that 100 gigawatt-hours would be allocated between your various end markets?\nElon Musk: I don't know, this is a bit too much guessing\nAndrew Baglino: Yes.\nElon Musk: But -- yes, Yes. I mean, you're right. Not all of the 100 gigawatt-hours are going to go into the Semi trucks, that is correct. Let's say like -- I alluded to a number of future products. Those future products would use the 4680.\nMartin Viecha: Thank you. And the next question comes from George from Canaccord Research.\nGeorge Gianarikas: Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. So you recently adjusted prices and that may have put many of your competitors in the back foot. In addition to that, capital markets have recently gotten a lot tougher. So with those factors in mind, I'm curious how you see the current competitive landscape changing over the next few years. And who do you see as your chief competitors five years from now?\nElon Musk: Five years is a long time. As with the Tesla order part, AI team, until late last night and just we're just asking guys like, so who do we think is close to Tesla with -- a general solution for self-driving? And we still don't even know really who would even be a distant second. So, yes, it really seems like we're -- I mean, right now, I don't think you could see a second place with a telescope, at least we can't. So, that wouldn't last forever. So, in five years, I don't know, probably somebody has figured it out. I don't think it's any of the car companies that we're aware of. But I'm just guessing that someone might be right out eventually, so yes.\nZachary Kirkhorn: I mean, beyond that, Elon, like in the vehicle space, even though the market is shrinking, we're growing and EVs have doubled almost year-over-year. So, like it ever keeps up with the trend of EVs is going to be our competitor. The Chinese are scary; we always say that. But like a lot of people always look at the EV market share, but we always look at it is how much of the total vehicle space do we have, and we're just going to keep growing in that space. There's 95% for us to go get.\nElon Musk: Yes. And I don't want to say like -- I think we have a lot of respect for the car companies in China. They are the most competitive in the world, that is our experience and the Chinese market, it is the most competitive. They work the hardest and they work the smartest, that's so for the China car companies that we're competing against. And so we would guess, there are probably some company out of China as the most likely to be second to Tesla. We are -- the Telsa China team is winning in China. And I think we actually are able to attract the best talent in China. So, hopefully, that continues. So, yes, so we're fired about the future and well, it's going to be great.\nGeorge Gianarikas: Just as a follow-up, the Inflation Reduction Act has created huge tax incentives for commercial vehicles. You mentioned an incredibly interesting product pipeline. Are there maybe some plans to accelerate commercial vehicle form factors outside of the Tesla Semi to help accelerate EV adoption?\nElon Musk: Well, I was basically saying that, yes, but I'm not going to give you details because this is -- nice try, nice try. Yes, of course, of course. So, we actually look at like, what is the limiting factor for new vehicles because if the -- for the longest time, we've been constrained on total cell lithium-ion production output. And so people said, like, why not bring this other car to market or that other car to market? Well, it doesn't really help if all you're doing is shuffling around the batteries from one car to another. In fact, it hurts because you add complexity, but you don't add incremental volume. So, it's sort of pointless, in fact, like counterproductive to add model complexity without solving the availability of lithium-ion batteries. So, as we get -- so we want new product introduction to match where the cells are available or that new product to use those cells without cannibalizing the cells of the other cars. That's the actual limiting factor for new models, not anything else really.\nMartin Viecha: Thank you. Let's go to the next question. The next question comes from William Stein from Truist.\nWilliam Stein: Great. Thanks for taking my question. You started to answer this earlier, but I'd like to ask this question about the AI elements of your business and ask if you could comment on progress around Dojo and Optimus and your anticipation for the likelihood, for example, for the company to disconnect the GPU cluster in favor of Dojo and to have some market achievement an Optimus?\nElon Musk: Yes. I mean, obviously, with -- just we're still at the early stages, there are big [indiscernible] in any predictions. It's like -- I think, easy to predict long-term, but hard to predict the time in between now and then. But it's -- we think Dojo will be competitive with the NVIDIA H1 at the end of this year and then hopefully surpass it next year. And the key there is -- I think what's the energy usage required for a given amount of -- if you're training a frame of video, how -- what's the energy cost required to do that training? And we think probably -- we said this already actually at AI Day, so it's not new information, but we do see potential for an order of magnitude improvement relative to GPU, what GPUs can do for Dojo, which is obviously very specialized for AI training. It's hyper-specialized for AI training. It's not -- wouldn't be great for other things, but it should be extremely good for AI training. So just like if you do an ASIC or something, it's going to be better than a CPU. This is sort of, in some ways, like a giant ASIC. And we're able to -- since we're operating one of the biggest GPU clusters in the world already, the -- we've got a good sense of how efficient the GPU clusters operate and what Dojo needs to do in order to be competitive. But we think that it does have a fundamental architectural advantage because it's designed not to be -- the GPU is trying to do many things for many people. We're trying to do graphics, video games. It's doing crypto mining. It's doing a lot of things. Dojo is just doing one thing and that is training. And we're also optimizing the low-level software too. So it had a various sort of, ground middle level so it's just insanely good at efficient training. And the intra-communication between the Dojo modules is extremely high. It's not going across an Ethernet cable. It's like -- so anyway, the -- we see a path to an order of magnitude improvement in the energy efficiency or per given unit of training. But we also have to achieve that. And so when will it be achieved? It's hard to say, but we do see a path to get there. And then also on inference, like once you've got something trained, well, if you want to have a product that's a consequence of that training, that product may not be anything to do with cars. Then the efficiency of inference is extremely important. And we also have, by far, the most efficient inference computer at the -- with the FSD computer in the car. This has potential for products that are in car even really in automotive.\nMartin Viecha: Thank you. And William, do you have a follow-up?\nWilliam Stein: Yes. It sounds like the 1.8 million units you expect this year is supply, not demand limited supply, it sounds like by the lithium batteries. If you were to become demand limited, can you talk to us about your propensity to use price and your relatively high industry margins to grow units and share?\nZachary Kirkhorn: Yes. To be clear, the 1.8 million is not cell supply limited. And I mean, we did address that number earlier in the call if you want to answer.\nElon Musk: Yes. It's roughly -- cell supply is roughly matched with that. And this 1.8 million cars, if we get lucky, it could be more. And then the rest would go into stationary storage, the Powerwall and Megapack. So, yes, so true.\nMartin Viecha: Okay. Let's have the final question from Adam Jonas.\nAdam Jonas: Hi. Elon, first question is, is it time for Tesla to significantly expand the captive finco? I mean, you only have like $4.5 billion of receivables. It's basically nothing compared to other big auto companies. And then I have a follow-up.\nElon Musk: Zach maybe is best to answer that.\nZachary Kirkhorn: Yes. I mean, the way that we've been using captive financing so far is to plug what we believe to be gaps in the market of existing third-party products. And so we have a couple of offerings in Europe. We do loans for our energy business, retail energy business here in the US. We do leasing and we do a small amount of U.S. loans that are very targeted. And so we're using captives to support market caps, as I mentioned. So basically, it's a vehicle to support vehicle sales, make sure customers have access. I do think there's opportunity here to continue to grow this. We are growing it slowly here. It is a consumer of cash, so we're being cautious on how we do that. But the plumbing is in place to do a lot more here. And I think we'll have to see how things unfold over the course of the year and make decisions real time as to how much we ramp it up versus ramp it back.\nElon Musk: I think if we see a severe recession this year, which like I said, hopefully, we don't, in severe recessions, cash is king big time, because it's in such short supply. So we want to be cautious about using cash for loans and that sort of thing for cars. I feel we're in a very strong position to get through a recession, because we really don't have any debt. And we've got over $20 billion of cash, which is great. The cash is earning a ridiculous return, a good return. So it's like nontrivial. And the interest rate actually in the $20 billion is earning like quite a good amount. And I've made this point on Twitter a few times. I'm sure a lot of people on this call understand the fact -- the basic value of a security is a function of the risk-free rate or we'll see how risk-free it really is but the T-bill rate. So if you've got -- I think the -- I recall correctly, the S&P 500 has a long-term rate of return of roughly 6%. And so I think that needs to be very cautious about having Fed rates that potentially exceeds 6%. Like, if we see deflation, and I think we are seeing deflation then you would add the deflation number to the 'risk-free rate' from the Fed. And as that starts to exceed 6%, now you're starting to exceed the long-term return of the S&P 500 and starts to become questionable as to why don't just put your money in a savings account essentially instead of in the S&P 500, if the S&P 500 is variable and the bank interest rate is not? This is -- so basically, the Fed is the risk of crushing the value of all equities, which is quite a serious, danger.\nAdam Jonas: Thanks Elon. And just a follow-up, I don't want to steal thunder from March 1st and in Austin, but how close are we to that step change improvement in BoM cost where you could sell an EV for under $25,000 or $30,000 and actually generate a profit, that kind of real moving assembly line moment in manufacturing? Again, I don't want to steal the thunder but just if you wanted to kind of wrap-up with thoughts there that would be helpful. Thanks Elon.\nElon Musk: I mean, I'd love to answer -- I'll probably be asking the same question, but we would be jumping the gun on future announcements.\nMartin Viecha: Fantastic. Thank you very much, everyone, for all your good questions. And we will see you again in three months' time.\nElon Musk: Thank you.\nMartin Viecha: Thank you. Bye-bye."}, {"symbol": "TSLA", "quarter": 3, "year": 2022, "date": "2022-10-19 22:14:04", "content": "Martin Viecha: Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to Tesla\u2019s Third Quarter 2022 Q&A Webcast. My name is Martin Viecha, VP of Investor Relations and I am joined today by Elon Musk, Zachary Kirkhorn and a number of other executives. Our Q3 results were announced at about 3:00 p.m. Central Time in the update deck we published at the same link as this webcast. During the call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC. During the Q&A session portion of today\u2019s call, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Please use the raise hand button to join the question queue. But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?\nElon Musk: Thank you, Martin. So just to do a Q3 recap. Q3 was another record quarter on many levels. We had our industry-leading operating margin reach 17%. And our free cash flow surpassed $3 billion in Q3 and approached $9 billion in the past 12 months. As our factories ramp, we\u2019re looking forward to a record-breaking Q4. So it really, knock on wood, looks like we\u2019ll have an epic end of year. So, Q4 is looking extremely good. On the production ramp, Giga Berlin achieved another milestone of 2,000 cars made in a week with very good quality and is ramping rapidly. Giga Austin or Giga Texas should reach this milestone very soon. And in fact, just yesterday, we extrapolated yesterday\u2019s build rate, it would be 2,000. Our production of 4680 cells has tripled in Q3 compared to the previous quarter. We are finally gaining rapid traction on the 4680 cell. And its output is growing rapidly, and we expect it to start incorporating in cars and having it be a significant portion of our production here in Texas in the coming months. We also have our second generation of manufacturing equipment for 4680 cells in Texas, which continues to show great progress along with our original pilot line in Fremont. The Fremont factory team once again reached record production in Q3. And we intend to keep raising production in Fremont. Regarding Autopilot, at the end of September, we hosted our second AI Day and drove the first prototype of our Optimus robot, released updates on our training computer and high range improvements of full self-driving software. Our vehicles have now driven nearly 60 miles in full self-driving Beta mode, and this number continues to grow exponentially. Our goal with that AI Day was to [post] (ph) recruiting, and we\u2019ve seen a massive influx of world-class artificial intelligence engineer and scientist resume. So, it generated a tremendous amount of interest from some of the best AI researchers in the world. I can\u2019t emphasize the importance of this enough because I think finally it has become clear to the smartest AI technologists in the world that Tesla is among the very best. So, this quarter, we expect to go to a wide release of full self-driving Beta in North America. So, anyone who has ordered a full self-driving Beta -- full self-driving, will have access to the FSD Beta program this year, probably about a month from now. So -- and then obviously, any new -- anyone who buys a car and purchases a full self-driving option, will immediately have that available to them. So, the safety that we\u2019re seeing when the car is in FSD mode is actually significantly greater than the safety we\u2019re seeing when it is not, which is a key threshold for going to a wide Beta. Let\u2019s see, with respect to demand. We\u2019ve got a lot of questions about demand in recent weeks. I can\u2019t emphasize enough, we have excellent demand for Q4, and we expect to sell every car that we make for as far into future as we can see. So, the factories are running at full speed, and we\u2019re delivering every car we make and keeping operating margins strong. We are still a very small percentage of the total vehicles on the road. Of the 2 billion cars and trucks on the road, we only have about 3.5 million. So, we\u2019ve got a long way to go to even reach 1% of the global fleet. Let\u2019s see. Based on many -- what people -- based on many things, but certainly questions I get on Twitter about buybacks. And I think every one of our Board members has gotten questions about buybacks. We\u2019ve debated the buyback idea extensively at the Board level. The Board generally thinks that it makes sense to do a buyback. But we want to work through the right process to do a buyback, but it\u2019s certainly possible for us to do a buyback on the order of $5 billion to $10 billion, even in the downside scenario next year, even -- given if next year is a very difficult year, we still have the ability to do a $5 billion to $10 billion buyback. This is obviously pending Board review and approval. So, it\u2019s likely that we\u2019ll do some meaningful buyback. So, in conclusion, while the market themes revolve around the short term, it\u2019s very important to focus on the long term. I can\u2019t emphasize this enough with investors and I think long-time investors, obviously recognize it with Tesla. You have your sort of local ups and downs, but long-term trend has been extremely good. And several years ago, I said, I think on an earnings call, and I thought it was possible for Tesla to be worth more than Apple, which was then the highest market cap company, I think, in the market. And Apple at that time, I think it was around $700 billion. And I said it required incredible execution, at least some luck, and we did indeed achieve that. Tesla went, in fact, or passed Apple\u2019s market cap at the time. And now, I\u2019m of the opinion that we can far exceed Apple\u2019s current market cap. In fact, I see a potential path for Tesla to be worth more than Apple and Saudi Aramco combined. So, now that doesn\u2019t mean it will happen or that will be easy. In fact, I think it will be very difficult. It will require a lot of work, some very creative new products, manage expansion and always the luck. But for the first time, I am seeing -- I see a way for Tesla to be -- let\u2019s say, roughly twice the value of Saudi Aramco. And I think that\u2019s -- I haven\u2019t quite seen that yet. I mean, this is the first time I\u2019ve seen that potential. So, we have an incredible product portfolio. I think we\u2019ve got the most exciting product portfolio of any company on earth, some of which you\u2019ve heard about, some of which you haven\u2019t. We\u2019re in the final lap for Cybertruck. We\u2019re building a Cybertruck line here at Giga Texas [Indiscernible] and making a lot of progress in the robotaxi platform design. And then, with respect to batteries, we\u2019re moving as fast as possible to have -- to achieve 1,000 gigawatt hours a year of production capacity in the United States, vertically integrated, anode-cathode, [Indiscernible] refining, we\u2019re moving at top speed to do that. So I think it\u2019s an incredibly exciting future and really an unprecedented future. None of this would be possible without the incredible team that we have here at Tesla. So, I\u2019d like to give a huge shout-out to all of our factory employees, engineers, executives and the whole Tesla team. You guys rock. You\u2019re the ones making it happen. Thank you. Thank you, everyone.\nMartin Viecha: Thank you very much. And Zach has some opening remarks as well.\nZachary Kirkhorn: Yes. Thanks, Martin. Just to continue on Elon\u2019s theme, I just want to thank and congratulate the Tesla team for achieving record vehicle deliveries, production and storage deployments in the third quarter. On automotive profitability, our GAAP operating margin was 17.2% with automotive gross margin at 27.9%. Operating margin is one of our best yet, with improvements in operating leverage. However, Austin and Berlin ramp costs weighed on our margins, particularly if you compare it to Q1. Removing regulatory credits and Austin and Berlin, our operating margins would have been our strongest yet and auto gross margin would have been nearly 30%. Note that while small and growing, each car we build in Austin and Berlin is contributing positively to profitability. We also continue to experience margin headwinds associated with macroeconomic conditions, as we\u2019ve discussed at length on prior calls. In particular, raw materials, logistics and foreign exchange was a big part of this past quarter. On energy profitability, we achieved our strongest gross profit yet for this business, driven primarily by record volumes of our Megapack and Powerwall products. Our free cash flows were also a record despite an increase in cars in transit at the end of the quarter, which has a negative impact on working capital. Specifically on cars in transit, as noted in our press release on October 2nd, we\u2019ve started to experience limits on outbound logistics capacity which we didn\u2019t anticipate. This issue is particularly present for ships from Shanghai to Europe and local trucking within certain parts of the U.S. and Europe. Our historical operating pattern of batch building by delivery region leads to extreme concentrations of outbound logistics needs in the final weeks of each quarter. Just to put this in perspective, roughly two-thirds of our Q3 deliveries occurred in September and one-third in the final two weeks. As a result, we\u2019ve begun to smooth the regional builds throughout the quarter to reduce our peak needs for outbound logistics. We expect this to simplify our operations, reduce costs and improve the experience of our customers. As we look ahead, our plans show that we\u2019re on track for the 50% annual growth in production this year, although we are tracking supply chain risks which are beyond our control. On the delivery side, we do expect to be just under 50% growth due to an increase in the cars in transit at the end of the year, as noted, just above. This means that, again, you should expect a gap between production and deliveries in Q4, and those cars in transit will be delivered shortly to their customers upon arrival to their destination in Q1. Austin and Berlin ramp costs will continue to weigh on margins, although we expect the impact to be less than what we saw in Q3. And as Elon mentioned, we are continuing to build as many cars as possible while also maintaining strong operating margins. Thank you.\nA - Martin Viecha: Thank you very much. And let\u2019s go first to the shareholder questions. The first shareholder question is, given the stringent battery content and assembly requirements for consumer tax credit eligibility under the Inflation Reduction Act, can you speak to Tesla\u2019s ability to meet those thresholds in each of 2023, 2024 and 2025 through your existing and planned supply chain?\nElon Musk: Well, yes, I mean, I think just at a high level, I\u2019d say, we do expect to fully meet the IRA\u2019s requirements. Do you want to add?\nZachary Kirkhorn: Yes. We view that passing of the Inflation Reduction Act as a significant boost towards accelerating automation, while also scaling the battery supply chain at large in the United States. We expect Treasury to publish detailed guidance by the end of the year. Until such time, it\u2019s difficult to fully determine the eligibility criteria, but we believe Tesla is very well positioned to capture a significant share of that for solar storage and also electric vehicles.\nElon Musk: Yes, like I said, we\u2019re -- like I said earlier, we\u2019re going to go basically pedal to the metal as fast as humanly possible to get to 1,000 gigawatt hours a year of production in the U.S. vertically integrated.\nMartin Viecha: Thank you. Let\u2019s go to the next question. The next question is, what updates can you offer on the backlog and the recent order intake trends, especially outside of the U.S. and especially in China?\u201d\nElon Musk: Well, it\u2019s -- there\u2019s definitely -- China is experiencing adverse of a recession of sorts, which is property market -- simply from a property market mostly. And Europe has recession of sorts driven by energy. The U.S. actually isn\u2019t -- North America is in a pretty good health, although the Fed is raising interest rates more than they should, but I think they\u2019ll eventually realize that and bring back down again. Demand is a little higher than it would otherwise be. But as I said earlier, we are extremely confident of the great Q4, and we anticipate continuing to grow our vehicle production, sales deliveries by -- on average 50% a year as far into the future as we can see.\nMartin Viecha: Thank you.\nElon Musk: Actually one caveat, I should say, growing production by 50% every year because deliveries -- we\u2019re trying to smooth out the deliveries and not have this crazy delivery rate at the end of every quarter, so. In fact, we\u2019re just fundamentally running out of -- there weren\u2019t enough boats, there weren\u2019t enough trains, there weren\u2019t enough car carriers to actually support the wave because it got too big. So, whether we like it or not, we actually have to smooth out the delivery of cars intra-quarter because there aren\u2019t just enough transportation objects to move them around.\nMartin Viecha: Thank you. The next question is, do you still expect 50% annualized growth for the foreseeable future? Is this also true specifically for the Chinese domestic market? Do you expect to need to cut vehicle prices or offer incentives in any market to sustain a demand, or has demand remained stable, or is it even rising? There are three questions there.\nElon Musk: Well, like I said, we want to sort of focus on a high level on what we think is possible here. We -- to the best of our knowledge, we believe that Tesla will continue to grow deliveries and revenue production at a 50% or greater compound annual growth rate. It might occasionally be a year that is a little less, and then some years would be maybe a little more or a lot more. In some of our out-year planning, we see potential annual growth rates that are in excess of 50%.\nMartin Viecha: Thank you. The next question is, \u201cCan you tell us more about the product future road map beyond new models and FSD, and especially for interior and powertrain of existing vehicle models?\nElon Musk: Yes. We could, but who wants? Sorry, guys, we can\u2019t like jumping on, on future product announcement.\nZachary Kirkhorn: Committed to continuing...\nElon Musk: Yes, we obviously are -- yes. But we\u2019ll also be committed to continuous growth. Yes. At Tesla, we\u2019ve always been committed to continuous improvement. So, as friends might have asked me like, when should I buy a car, I\u2019m like now because we just keep improving the cars.\nZachary Kirkhorn: There\u2019s always the latest Tesla.\nElon Musk: Yes, there\u2019s still latest Tesla. I don\u2019t really -- yes, the -- every now and again, we do have some big technology upgrade, like Plaid. And by the way, I think the Plaid Model S and X are the best cars on earth. There\u2019s nothing even close, in my opinion. Just try one. Epic.\nMartin Viecha: Thank you. The next question is, \u201cWe keep hearing of dire energy crisis in Germany this winter. What are Tesla\u2019s plans to combat power cuts? And will there be any delays in ramp-up in production from Giga Berlin because of this?\u201d\nZachary Kirkhorn: Yes, I can take that. I think two points on this question. The first is just that based upon everything that we know, we don\u2019t see this as a large risk to the Company. Even if production did go down for a period of time, this is on near term, it doesn\u2019t have any impact on the long term of the Company.\nElon Musk: But we don\u2019t -- we have no indication whatsoever that we will have to cut our production in Germany.\nZachary Kirkhorn: No. And we put in place backup plans, and we\u2019re working through the supply chain as well. Nearly all of our suppliers are prepared as well. So, we\u2019ll see how this plays out, but it\u2019s not something that we\u2019re terribly worried about.\nMartin Viecha: Thank you. And the next question is, \u201cHow is production planning going for the Cybertruck? What is the initial Phase 1 production target? When can we expect an update on pricing and final design?\u201d\nUnidentified Company Representative: I mean, as Elon said earlier, we\u2019d be -- facilities preparations here in Giga Texas for Cybertruck. We\u2019re still on track to enter early production in the middle of next year. We started our data builds of all of the battery body in existing...\nElon Musk: When should I drop my beta?\nUnidentified Company Representative: In a few weeks. That\u2019s going well, and we continue ramping up through the end of next year and into 2023.\nElon Musk: Great. Yes, the car is going to be sick and -- sick. That is going to be a hall of famer, next level. Sorry, it took longer than expected, but there were a few things that got in the way, like insane global supply chain shortages like FedEx, which are force majeures if everyone.\nMartin Viecha: Right. Thank you.\nElon Musk: Of course. There\u2019s Tesla Semi, of course. So, we\u2019ll be handing over our first production Tesla Semis to Pepsi on December 1st. I\u2019ll be there in person. And we will begin ramping up production of the Tesla Semi, which is a max low, heavy -- heavy truck. That\u2019s a Class A truck, Class A truck.\nZachary Kirkhorn: No sacrifice to cargo capacity.\nElon Musk: Yes, exactly, very important, no sacrifice to cargo capacity, 500-mile range. Just to be clear, 500 miles with the cargo. Yes, 500 miles with the cargo on level ground. Yes, sure. Not up. It\u2019s excellent. But the point is, it\u2019s a long-range truck and even with heavy cargo. And the number of times people tell, no, you can\u2019t -- it\u2019s impossible to make a long-range heavy-duty Class A truck. And then, I\u2019ll ask, well, what are your assumptions about what hour kilogram and what hours per mile, and they look at me with a blank stare and then say hydrogen. I\u2019m like, no, that\u2019s not the answer, I was looking for numbers, literally. It\u2019s not a number. It\u2019s [indiscernible] table. You obviously don\u2019t need hydrogen for heavy truck. And we\u2019ll be ramping up Semi production through next year. As I think everyone knows at this point, it takes about a year to ramp up production. So, we expect to see significant -- we\u2019re tentatively aiming for 50,000 units in 2024 for Tesla Semi in North America. And obviously, we\u2019ll expand beyond North America. And these would sell -- I don\u2019t want to say the exact prices, but they\u2019re much more than a passenger vehicle. So, with a few thousand heavy trucks of this nature, it would be worth several Model Ys.\nMartin Viecha: Thank you. The next question is, what is the progress of the 4680 cell ramp? And what factors determine whether vehicles get 2170s versus 4680 cells? And how will that change in the next year?\nZachary Kirkhorn: Yes, ramp is going well, as Elon said. Total output is up 3x quarter-over-quarter, and production is tracking to exceed 1,000 car cells per week this quarter, as we said last quarter. Our focus is now shifting from 100% ramp to cost and further expanding production capacity in North America, as Elon also mentioned. On the 2170 versus 4680, in our factories, we really attempt to minimize factory complexity and product changeover while still making sure we get enough new product into the field to learn how it is performing. And that sort of mix is going to shift as 4680 scales here and the overall factory ramp proceeds in Texas.\nElon Musk: Right. Basically, production of 4680 ramp is growing exponentially. And yes, it\u2019s going well. We\u2019re just looking at this -- just going to be a major pack in the future.\nZachary Kirkhorn: [Indiscernible]\nElon Musk: Yes. And like I said, we\u2019re -- our goal is to strive towards 1,000 gigawatt hours a year of annualized production in United States alone by Tesla, not including [indiscernible], will be on top of that.\nUnidentified Company Representative: We need to get 300 to 400 terawatt hours to accomplish our goal.\nElon Musk: Yes, there\u2019s roughly -- to transition to sustainable energy, our calculation for both stationary and vehicles is 300,000 to 400,000 gigawatt hours or 300 to 400 terawatt hours.\nUnidentified Company Representative: So when you\u2019re like one tower assembling a lot, well, a lot of terawatt hours to go by.\nElon Musk: Yes. On the cathode side -- we think it will probably be iron and most of the iron -- iron can scale to very, very high tonnage and then some nickel. The exact percentages are hard to figure out, but it\u2019s -- probably be twice as much iron cathodes as they call, maybe more. And then there\u2019s the manganese wildcard as well.\nUnidentified Company Representative: And on that note, we\u2019re pursuing aggressively North American iron supplies. And how -- yes, we can talk more about that at a future date.\nMartin Viecha: Thank you. The next question was on the Semi truck, which we already addressed. So I\u2019m going to skip to the next one. Can you talk about how Tesla could adjust if we were to enter a prolonged recession, including new product prioritization, investment flexibility, new factory versus factory expansion, service support infrastructure, productivity cost measures and demand stimulation alternatives?\nElon Musk: Well, to be frank, we\u2019re very pedal to the metal come rain or shine. So, we are not reducing our production in a meaningful way, recession or not recession.\nZachary Kirkhorn: It\u2019s the 1% point come in.\nElon Musk: Yes, exactly. So I think the public, at large, realizes that everyone\u2019s moving towards electric vehicles and that it\u2019s foolish to actually buy a new gasoline car at this point because the residual value of that gasoline car is going to be very low. So, I think we have to be in a very good spot. But I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s recession proof, but it\u2019s certainly recession resilient because basically earth has -- people both have in large part made the decision to move away from gasoline cars to electric cars. And then, in transitioning a generation to sustainable, you need solar and wind with the stationary battery pack to buffer the power. So, you have 24/7 power because the wind doesn\u2019t go -- travel time. So that also -- we actually see the energy storage business, stationary storage, growing more like 150% to 200% a year, faster than cars by a lot.\nZachary Kirkhorn: Just to add before you jump in, Martin. Just to echo Elon\u2019s point, I mean, I think where our cash balance is, what our forecasted cash generation is, where our margins are as a company, I mean we can withstand quite a lot of downside before we would have to dig into our capital plans, Supercharger expansion, product lineup. So, the business has done quite well over the last handful of quarters. And this is a real opportunity, I think, for the Company to press forward, in most aggressive way, as Elon has mentioned.\nElon Musk: Yes. And we try to model out like, let\u2019s say, 2023 is a brutal recession year. Even then, we generate meaningful cash. Once you get out of that\u2026\nMartin Viecha: Great. Thank you very much. And let\u2019s go to the last investor question, which is the progression from Tesla\u2019s first platform with S and X to the second platform with 3 and Y, led to a 50% reduction in cost of goods sold. When do you see Tesla\u2019s third platform being released? And what level of cost of goods sold reduction could you achieve?\nElon Musk: Well, we don\u2019t want to talk exact dates, but this is a -- I mean, the primary focus of our new vehicle development team, obviously. At this point, we\u2019ve done the engineering for Cybertrucks and for Semi. So, it\u2019s obviously against what we\u2019re working on, which is the next-generation vehicle, which will be probably about the cost of 3 and Y platform. It will be smaller, to be clear. But it will, I think, certainly become -- certainly exceed the production of all our other vehicles combined. I mean, obviously, we\u2019re going to take everything we learned from S, X, 3, Y, Cybertruck and Semi and forward into that platform. But we -- as you\u2019ve said to us many times, we\u2019re on a 2-for-1 target. So, we\u2019re trying to get to that 50% number again. It\u2019s like, we\u2019re going to take two. That\u2019s exactly what [indiscernible] how we make two cars for the amount of effort that currently takes us to make one Model 3.\nZachary Kirkhorn: Yes. Effort costs.\nElon Musk: Yes\u2026\nZachary Kirkhorn: Half the loss, half the past, half the factory floor space.\nElon Musk: We\u2019re twice the output. And we do believe this can be done. By the way, I should mention that -- when I said that probably now that I see a path in extremely -- very difficult path, incredible execution required, a massive amount of hard work and some luck to get to where Tesla is with as much as Apple and Saudi Aramco combined, I wasn\u2019t including Optimus.\nMartin Viecha: Thank you. Let\u2019s go to analyst questions next. The first question comes from Adam Jonas from Morgan Stanley. Adam, go ahead and unmute.\nAdam Jonas: Great. Can you hear me?\nMartin Viecha: Yes.\nElon Musk: Yes.\nAdam Jonas: So Elon, would you consider vertically integrating into mining? That\u2019s my first question.\nElon Musk: We\u2019ll do whatever we have to. Whatever the limiting factor is, we\u2019ll do. We do not personally constrain ourselves. We don\u2019t particularly integrate just for the hell of particularly integrating. Like if there was a great supplier who\u2019s better than us or we think actively is very good, or even where the economics of comparative advantage suggest that we should use that supplier, even if we could beat them, but we could use our resources to do something else that will be more productive, then we would in source in that case. But if we have to go mine, we will mine.\nAdam Jonas: Okay. Thanks, Elon. My follow-up is 1 terawatt hour of manufacturing in the United States, vertically integrated. I guess, my question is, what would need to change with U.S. permitting laws to allow that? Kind of what would be your message to this administration or next? And do you think you could do a terawatt hour? What\u2019s the going price of that? Can you do that for under $100 billion in the States? Thanks.\nElon Musk: Well, I mean, I think the message to the government would be that there should be -- I should say, we\u2019ve actually had conversations with a number of senior government leaders, White House, Congress and whatnot. And the suggestion that we have is that there should be an expedited permitting process for anything which is critical to a sustainable energy future. So, it doesn\u2019t make sense to put like a coal mine and a sustainable energy battery like lithium mine in the same category. Coal does not in the future, lithium does. And by the way, you can extract lithium with almost no disturbance to the local environment. So, it\u2019s not actually ugly, nasty mine situation. So, I would recommend expedited permitting would really be helpful. Basically, a fast track environmentally -- I think in sense fast track things that are important for the environment and humanity for sure. That seems logical. And the reception has been positive. So, we\u2019ll see if something happens with that. I think probably on this earnings call, we\u2019re not ready to go into financial details of the -- what it will take to get there. But what we are seeing is practical improvements as we redesign the whole supply chain and all of the elements that go into battery cell. We\u2019re figuring out dramatic efficiencies. And I think we\u2019ll -- net result which would be that the capital required to achieve that level of output will be much less than what people think.\nMartin Viecha: Thank you very much. Let\u2019s go to the next question from Colin Langan from Wells Fargo. Colin, go ahead and unmute.\nColin Langan: Can you hear me now?\nMartin Viecha: Yes, we can hear you.\nColin Langan: Okay. Sorry about that. Any update on full self-driving? I think you had said a couple of quarters ago, it would be available by the end of the year. Is that still possible? Is it -- would it still be like a Level 4 or Level 5 that you\u2019re talking about? And are there any sort of regulatory hurdles you\u2019d have to think about?\nElon Musk: We -- as I said earlier, we\u2019re expecting to release the full self-driving software to anyone who orders the package by the end of this year. So, a separate matter as to will it have regulatory approval. It won\u2019t have regulatory approval at that time. But the car will be able to take you from your home to your work, your friend\u2019s house, to the grocery store without you touching wheel. So, it\u2019s looking very good.\nColin Langan: And it would mean like Level 4, Level 5 kind of traditional definition you\u2019re talking about?\nElon Musk: Well, there\u2019s - this debate is like what\u2019s the -- what are the interventions per mile and maybe safety interventions per mile. Like we\u2019re not saying that that\u2019s quite ready to have no one behind the wheel. It\u2019s just that you will almost never have to touch the control, vehicle controllers. So, like when I came to Giga Texas from Brent\u2019s house, I never touched any of the controls already here. And then there is a longer process of like called the march of nines of like how many nines reliability do you need before you could really be comfortable saying that the car could drive with no one in it. And that\u2019s some subjectivity as to how many nines you need. But I think we\u2019ll be pretty close to having enough nines that you\u2019re going to have no one in the car by the end of this year. And certainly, without a question, that\u2019s whatever in my mind next year. I think we\u2019ll also have an update next year to be able to show to regulators that the car is safer much so than the average human.\nColin Langan: Got it. And just as a follow-up. You mentioned in the prior questions about IRA. I mean, it sounded like you thought you could get -- can you get all of it? I mean, because my interpretation is like the production credits, battery component credits for buyers seems very likely for you guys. Is the sourcing part of it possible? Because that seems like a pretty tough hurdle given how much has to be sourced from the U.S.\nUnidentified Company Representative: Yes. So, we have a cross-functional team that\u2019s looking very closely. As you mentioned, the sourcing threshold increases by the year. So, we\u2019re looking at all options and also getting some clarification from Treasury. That\u2019s -- it\u2019s important to say that\u2019s only a fraction of the other credits. We do manufacture ourselves in the U.S. We manufacture the modules in the U.S. So, that\u2019s a pretty thin. So yes, we feel confident that we\u2019ll have a path as these incentives -- as the threshold sort of increases by the year.\nElon Musk: Yes. We\u2019ll meet those thresholds..\nMartin Viecha: Thank you. The next question comes from Colin Rusch from Oppenheimer.\nColin Rusch: The operating leverage has been pretty impressive here. And I\u2019m curious about areas where you could invest in an incremental way, whether it\u2019s on the R&D side or on the sales side to accelerate growth or cost reduction, or should we be thinking about this level of spend on a go-forward basis and some significant operating leverage as you scale up from here?\nZachary Kirkhorn: Yes. I mean, our operating leverage has improved quite a bit. It\u2019s the lowest this quarter, I think, ever, and by a decent amount, OpEx as a percentage of revenue. I mean, our forecast is that it will keep reducing. I mean, I think the way to think about it is our total amount of operating expenses will slowly tick up as the company grows. It\u2019s very hard to keep it flat with the rapid growth of the Company, but it\u2019s growing much slower. So some amount of growth there, but the top line of the business is growing so quickly. So, I think there continues to be enormous opportunity to improve the overhead efficiency of the business, and we\u2019re seeing it.\nElon Musk: Yes. Look, we are in the -- at least for now, quite in a good position of -- we\u2019re investing in everything we can think of to possibly invest in, and we\u2019re still generating cash. So, I guess, it gets a pretty good place to be.\nZachary Kirkhorn: Yes. I mean, how many R&D programs are we running in parallel right now?\nElon Musk: People don\u2019t even know old R&D stuff for that. There are some of it, but a bunch of it.\nZachary Kirkhorn: I also don\u2019t think cash is a good gauge of how much R&D you\u2019re doing.\nElon Musk: No. It isn\u2019t because like it\u2019s not like -- it\u2019s not like engineers -- they\u2019re not generic. So it\u2019s just like if you could you spend $5 billion or $10 billion, that will like -- that your actual R&D -- useful product ship will be proportionate to that. It\u2019s just not true. Engineers on -- coming off some assembly line like cookies or something.\nZachary Kirkhorn: Until we get optimistic.\nElon Musk: Get optimistic. Don\u2019t change things. What matters is where are the most brilliant people working? And Tesla remains the -- Tesla and SpaceX are two companies where the smartest engineers want to work.\nZachary Kirkhorn: I mean, like we don\u2019t have to spend billions of dollars to invest in the future and invent the future. Engineers are also cost conscious. And we don\u2019t just burn the money out the window when we\u2019re trying to do R&D. I wouldn\u2019t stop looking at like R&D as a cash investment for...\nElon Musk: I think 1 nickel Tesla is frankly worth an infinite number of dollars. You could have like a -- almost same the number of credit shares and they would not be able to do work 1 nickel of Tesla we can do. You can\u2019t make it up in volume.\nMartin Viecha: Okay. Thank you very much. Let\u2019s go to the next question from George at Canaccord.\nGeorge Gianarikas: I think, at your Annual Shareholders\u2019 event, where Elon mentioned that the prices of many of the materials used in your production have started to come off the boil. If that continues, does that give you an opportunity to adjust prices globally after several increases? Thanks.\nElon Musk: Well, we\u2019re looking at the prices of -- prices closely. I mean, obviously, anyone can just Google what the price of -- future price of copper or steel is going to be. It\u2019s just like one Google Search away. And everyone can see that the commodities on a go-forward basis are on a dropping a lot. But in electric vehicles, things like battery-grade lithium are still crazy expensive. So, we\u2019ve got a mixture of things where prices are dropping and things where prices are increasing.\nUnidentified Company Representative: Yes. I would say quarter-over-quarter, steel -- aluminum has stopped anywhere between 17% to 20% at the same time on the battery side.\nZachary Kirkhorn: And cost of shipping has come down tremendously. Like last year, the cost of a container on the spot market from Shanghai got as high as $20,000. And now it\u2019s $3,500, $3,600. It\u2019s that kind of reality. We\u2019re seeing deflation in a lot of commodities with a few exceptions as Elon mentioned on batteries.\nElon Musk: There\u2019s more deflation than inflation.\nZachary Kirkhorn: Definitely.\nElon Musk: And again, this is publicly available information. Anyone could just Google it. And I think Cathie Wood at Ark Invest is making this point over and over again, to the Fed and the Fed is not listening because they\u2019re looking at the rearview mirror instead of looking out the front windshield.\nZachary Kirkhorn: Yes. Just to add a little bit more context. So, commodity increases were the highest in Q3 that we\u2019ve seen over the last two years. And so, when indexes change, it does take time before they fully reflect.\nElon Musk: Yes. There\u2019s latency.\nZachary Kirkhorn: Yes. There\u2019s latency.\nElon Musk: That\u2019s why I say that the Fed\u2019s decisions make sense if you\u2019re looking out through the rearview mirror, but not if you look out the windshield. And actually we\u2019ve got front windshield.\nZachary Kirkhorn: Yes. And so what -- at least of what we know so far, the peak on the commodity side in Q3 -- I say peak, hopefully, it stays the peak, hopefully, it starts to come down. There is a small amount of production that we\u2019re seeing going into our Q4 cost structure from steel and aluminum primarily, but it\u2019s less than 10% of the total increases we\u2019ve seen so far. So we\u2019re optimistic here based upon what we\u2019re seeing on the indexes for some of our cost structure that this will start to come in over time. But I just want to set expectations that there\u2019s not some windfall of cost reduction in this space coming in Q4, maybe some as we go into next year.\nElon Musk: Yes. We\u2019ll probably see some cost reduction in 2023. I\u2019ll be surprised if we did not.\nGeorge Gianarikas: And just as a follow-up, this is for Elon. With your pending acquisition of Twitter and your stakes in SpaceX and Neuralink and Tesla, how much would the combined companies benefit from operating under a single super structure, if at all, like a Google Alphabet?\nElon Musk: It\u2019s not clear to me what the overlap is. It\u2019s not zero, but it\u2019s -- I think we\u2019re reaching. I\u2019m not worried about it. I\u2019m not an investor. I\u2019m an engineer and a manufacturing person and a technologist. So, I actually work and design and develop products. That\u2019s what I do. So, it\u2019s not a -- we\u2019re not going to have a portfolio sort of investments over it. So, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t see obvious sort of some -- get combined under an umbrella, at least right now. So, I am excited about the Twitter situation because obviously another part incredibly well. And I think it\u2019s massive that this sort of languished for a long time, but has an incredible potential. Although, obviously, myself and the other investors are obviously overpaying for Twitter right now, the long-term potential for Twitter, in my view, is, in order of magnitude, greater than its current value.\nMartin Viecha: Let\u2019s go to the next question from Pierre Ferragu from New Street Research.\nPierre Ferragu: Can you hear me, guys?\nMartin Viecha: Yes, we can hear you now.\nPierre Ferragu: Great. I\u2019d love to have another update on 4680, Drew. So last time we talked about it, there were -- it was a question about like scaling up with manufacturing and there were still a few things to get right. Is it fair to say that now you are at scale, and it\u2019s just a question of logistics to get bigger? So, that\u2019s question number one. And then, question number two, on the kind of like innovation and cost reduction and efficiency improvements kind of path that you described at the battery day, where are we today? And how much time is it going to take to deliver all the potential you outlined then?\nUnidentified Company Representative: Well, I\u2019ll take the second question first. At Battery Day, we showed a time line out to 2026 for all of the ideas we had proposed and had shared with everybody then.\nElon Musk: Yes, I\u2019d be surprised. I think we\u2019ll do better than that.\nUnidentified Company Representative: Yes. I mean, but just that\u2019s the rough -- just give to you all -- it\u2019s on that order. It\u2019s not like a month. It\u2019s not six months. It\u2019s years. And we are executing on all of those different ideas pretty aggressively in parallel with the OpEx that some people think isn\u2019t enough, but we\u2019re getting it done.\nElon Musk: I mean, I\u2019m turning down.\nUnidentified Company Representative: Yes, yes. We\u2019re great talent, like we find someone awesome, we bring them into the company. And people shouldn\u2019t believe we are turning people away.\nElon Musk: Yes. I mean, it\u2019s a hot pond but we\u2019re solving it. And I think -- we still feel confident that 4680 will be the most competitive battery cell in the world.\nUnidentified Company Representative: It\u2019s the whole system around it, right? It\u2019s not necessarily a specific form factor. It\u2019s the attention to detail on how to bring costs out of the manufacturing process -- or remove processing steps.\nElon Musk: And all the way down from the mine to the cell.\nUnidentified Company Representative: Yes, exactly.\nElon Musk: Many steps along the way.\nUnidentified Company Representative: Yes. And for those who watched the YouTube videos, like our on-site cathode facilities coming together, I\u2019m really excited about that, which is a part of the plan that we discussed on Battery Day.\nElon Musk: Yes. We\u2019re also building lithium refinery.\nUnidentified Company Representative: In Corpus Christi. So, we\u2019re making -- putting our money where our mouths are and all the various efforts that we discussed on Battery Day. On the technical challenges and the ramp question, which is your first question of 4680, no ramp is ever easy even at the end when you\u2019re 80% to the end, like it\u2019s still very challenging to get to the end. And that sort of leaning out of yields, the final cycle time to achieve target. You mentioned logistics. It\u2019s not something that we\u2019re specifically focused on, I guess, but eventually could be a problem as we\u2019re talking about hundreds of gigawatt hours at different sites across the United States. But I would never sit here and say we have no challenges remaining, but we\u2019ve made a lot of progress reducing technical risk in many areas. Cycle times have dramatically improved. Yield has dramatically improved. And just walking the line here in Texas, like Martin was walking it yesterday, made some comments to me. You really see the acceleration around you. And we\u2019ve made a ton of simplifications moving from the Fremont factory to Texas, and it\u2019s coming to play in speed of ramp here. And of course, that\u2019s on one line of many here in Texas. So it\u2019s not like factory to factory. It\u2019s a multiplication of both, simplicity and scale. So yes, we\u2019re excited about where it\u2019s headed.\nElon Musk: Yes. And I think, once we are fully integrated, I think we still do see a path to hold roughly $70 a kilowatt hour cell -- $70 per kilowatt hour cell, before any incentive.\nUnidentified Company Representative: Before incentive.\nElon Musk: Before incentive.\nMartin Viecha: Thank you. And the next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi from Bernstein.\nToni Sacconaghi: I just wanted to follow up on the 4680 cells and where we are seeing them deployed today. So, are those in the Semis that are being delivered on December 1st? Are we seeing them in Model Ys that are being produced out of Austin? And is -- do you anticipate 4680 being a gating factor for Cybertruck ramp later this year? And how do you balance the need for 4680 across Semi, Cybertruck and potentially Model Y in 2023? And I have a follow-up, please.\nElon Musk: Okay. The Semi doesn\u2019t use 4680s. Yes. We are making Model Ys. Some of the Model Ys coming out of Giga Texas are 4680. And I think, Drew, the car you drive around is 4680 Model Y?\nUnidentified Company Representative: Yes. 10,000 miles.\nElon Musk: 10,000 miles. Pretty good.\nUnidentified Company Representative: No problems yet.\nElon Musk: Yes. Structural pack.\nUnidentified Company Representative: Structural pack.\nElon Musk: Yes. And yes, I mean -- and our output 4680 is growing exponentially. But it\u2019s worth bearing in mind like there are entire highly competitive companies that are very smart that all they do is make battery cells. This is simply one segment of Tesla. So, it\u2019s not a total...\nUnidentified Company Representative: No, there aren\u2019t -- there are challenges still ahead that we have not yet surpassed. No doubt.\nElon Musk: We don\u2019t anticipate this being anything -- like Cybertruck or anything else.\nMartin Viecha: Okay. Thank you. And the last question comes from William Stein from Truist.\nWilliam Stein: I guess, I\u2019ll go at one that I asked last time, Elon, which is your expectation for the likelihood of commercial success in each of the three major AI endeavors. FSD, sort of as imagined without a driver, the training computer and, of course, Optimus.\nElon Musk: We\u2019ll achieve full self-driving full autonomy -- I look at that occurring is 100%. And I think we\u2019ll -- we\u2019re almost there. And then, of course, we\u2019ve got to prove it to regulators and get the regulatory approvals, which is outside of our control. But anyone who\u2019s driving full self-driving cars -- has full self-driving Beta in the car, you can see the rate of improvement. You can just experience for yourself that we are, in fact, getting there. In fact, we almost are there. And so, we\u2019re probably -- achieving that 100%. The Optimus, probably of that being a successful product, I think, it\u2019s also extremely high given enough time, 100%. Dojo, just maybe more of a question around Dojo, like can we be competitive with NVIDIA GPUs even as NVIDIA continues to rapidly evolve their GPUs. So the jury is out on Dojo. Dojo team, they can outperform NVIDIA for Neuralink training. The jury\u2019s out. We will probably know -- I don\u2019t know, next year, if that\u2019s true or not. But we think we\u2019ll probably -- we think it\u2019s -- this is -- the architecture of Dojo is the right architecture to win. Yes. It depends on how well we execute in that architecture.\nMartin Viecha: Thank you very much. I think, unfortunately, it\u2019s all the time that we have today. So, thank you so much for your great questions, and look forward to talking to you in about three months from now. Thank you, and have a good day.\nElon Musk: Thanks, everyone."}, {"symbol": "TSLA", "quarter": 2, "year": 2022, "date": "2022-07-20 22:04:02", "content": "Martin Viecha: Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to Tesla\u2019s Second Quarter 2022 Q&A Webcast. My name is Martin Viecha, VP of Investor Relations; and I am joined today by Elon Musk, Zachary Kirkhorn and a number of other executives. Our Q2 results were announced at about 3:00 p.m. Central Time in the update deck we published at the same link as this webcast. During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC. During the question-and-answer portion of today\u2019s call, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. [Operator Instructions] But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?\nElon Musk: Thank you, Martin. So, just as a Q2 recap, Q2 was a unique quarter for Tesla due to a prolonged shutdown of our Shanghai factory. But in spite of all these challenges, it was one of the strongest quarters in our history. Most importantly, in June, we achieved production records in both Fremont and Shanghai. And as a result, we have the potential for a record-breaking second half of the year. I do want to emphasize this was obviously subject to force majeure, things outside of our control. The past few years have been quite a few force majeures and it\u2019s been kind of supply chain hell for several years. Credit to our awesome Tesla supply chain team for overcoming entirely difficult challenges and huge thanks to the Tesla Shanghai factory team who sacrificed a lot to get the factory back up and running in June and achieve a record output. So, also making good progress with production ramp with Berlin. We achieved an important milestone of 1,000 cars a week in June. And we are expecting \u2013 sorry, our Giga Texas to exceed the 1,000 vehicle per week milestone, hopefully in the next few months. To be clear, we are currently making the cars with the 2170 cells and Drew Baglino will address some of the 4680 questions later in this call. But it is worth emphasizing that we have enough 2170 cells to satisfy all vehicle production for the remainder of the year. So we are not dependent on 4680. 4680 will be important next year but it is not important for this year. That said we have installed the second generation of manufacturing equipment for 4680 cells in Texas. And even at our established factories like Fremont and Shanghai, we continue to expand capacity. Regarding Autopilot, we have now deployed our FSD beta with City Streets driving capability to over 100,000 owners. They are very happy with the capability of the system and we will continue to improve it every week. We have now driven over 35 million miles with FSD beta. That\u2019s more autonomous miles than any company we are aware of, I think probably more than \u2013 it might be more than any \u2013 all other companies combined. So \u2013 and that mileage is growing exponentially. With regard to manufacturing and technology, about 5 or 6 years ago, we said we wanted to become the best manufacturer in the world and that is somewhat counterintuitively, to some people, will actually be, I think, our strongest competitive advantage. We are super pro-manufacturing here at Tesla. And in general, we want to encourage other companies to be super pro-manufacturing. And in general, I think it is a very important thing to do. We need to make stuff and make it efficiently and that\u2019s manufacturing. So we\u2019ve made a lot of advancements in manufacturing processes. As we now show in the shareholder deck, thanks to our \u2013 the large castings, we make the world\u2019s largest castings. We reduced body welding robot count by 70% per unit of capacity in Austin and Berlin. So that\u2019s, call it, roughly a body shop that is roughly 3x smaller than would normally be the case. And I should say it\u2019s also lighter, cheaper and has superior noise vibration harshness. So, it\u2019s good on every level. But this journey is not over. We will bring another level of simplicity and manufacturing improvements with Cybertruck and future products that we are not quite ready to talk about now, but I think will be very exciting to unveil in the future. Our safety team also introduced a feature that tension seat builds, if the vision system detects imminent collision, which has never been done before. So, you can imagine that if you have a seatbelt that only tensions upon impact you have very little time to tension the seatbelt. If you have got to be \u2013 the car has got to be crunching to trigger the seatbelt tensioner, but because we have vision, we can actually see that a collision is about to occur with 100% probability before it actually happens. And so we can tension the seatbelts and we can even adjust the airbag deployment, because we can see, not just feel. This is a fundamental safety advantage that Teslas are now able to offer. And there is also an over-the-air update, so this is something that will be in place in all cars that have at least AP3 hardware. In conclusion, we exited Q2 with a strong production rate than ever before. Our team continues to focus on Cybertruck production readiness and some future platform design. We are expecting to be \u2013 still expecting to be in production with the Cybertruck in the middle of next year. And we are very, very excited about that product. I think it might actually be our best product ever. Let\u2019s see. And FSD beta is on track to be released for all of North American customers before the end of this year. And hopefully, if we get regulatory approval, we will also be releasing it hopefully in Europe and some other parts of the world. We are hosting our AI Day in a few months. I think people will be amazed at what we are able to show off in AI Day. So basically, there is a tremendous amount to look forward to in the second half of this year. And I want to thank all of our employees and suppliers for their super hard work during these challenging times. Super appreciate it. Thank you.\nMartin Viecha: Thank you very much. And Zach has some opening remarks as well.\nZachary Kirkhorn: Yes. Thanks, Martin. I want to start by congratulating the Tesla team on an excellent execution during the second quarter. Although our production volume reduced sequentially due to COVID-related shutdowns in Shanghai, we made substantial progress in nearly every area of the business, and in particular, our global vehicle production rate as we exited the quarter. Our Fremont factory, supported by our Reno team, reached new production records. The Shanghai factory resumed full production and our new factories in Austin and Berlin are progressing well through their initial ramps. Additionally, our energy business achieved record gross profit with the highest solar volumes in many years. I want to personally thank the entire Tesla team, as I know many of you are listening. You have embodied a remarkable and relentless pursuit of excellence in support of our mission. I also want to thank our suppliers for their support during another complicated quarter. On GAAP automotive gross margin, it declined sequentially to 27.9%. The temporary decline in Shanghai production volume meaningfully impacted margin, including idle capacity and factory restart costs and also had implications on the mix of regional deliveries. Additionally, as discussed on previous calls, we are working through the ramp inefficiencies of our new factories, which are progressing well, but have had an impact on margin as those factories come online. While we continue to see a benefit from higher pricing flowing through, which experienced some foreign exchange-related headwinds, our cost structure continues to experience cost increases from inflation, commodities and logistics. The energy business progressed well in Q2, aided by alternate solar supply coming online and progress on unit economics. Our storage business remains component-constrained on both Powerwall and Megapack, which we hope will alleviate to some extent in the second half of the year. We are greatly appreciative of the patience and flexibility shown by our customers while we work through these challenges. Within operating expenses, Boston and Berlin-related startup costs have wound down as these factories have moved into production and their costs are now reflected in automotive COGS. Additionally, we converted a majority of our Bitcoin holdings to Fiat for a realized gain, offset by impairment charges on the remainder of our holdings, netting a $106 million cost to the P&L included within restructuring and other. We also incurred restructuring charges related to targeted staffing reductions.\nElon Musk: Yes, actually, it should be mentioned that the reason we sold a bunch of our Bitcoin holdings was that we were uncertain as to when the COVID lockdowns in China would alleviate. So it was important for us to maximize our cash position, given the uncertainty of the COVID lockdowns in China. We are certainly open to increasing our Bitcoin holdings in future. So this should not be taken as some verdict on Bitcoin. It\u2019s just that we were concerned about overall liquidity for the company given COVID shutdowns in China. And we have not sold any of our Dogecoin.\nZachary Kirkhorn: We still have it.\nElon Musk: We still have our Dogecoin.\nZachary Kirkhorn: Despite these challenges, we were still able to achieve one of our strongest operating margins at 14.6%. Our free cash flows were impacted by working capital related to the Shanghai factory shutdown. However, we expect this will show as a benefit in Q3 as our working capital-related cash flows restabilize. As we look ahead and as Elon mentioned, we are positioned for a record-breaking second half of the year. We are quite excited about this. A couple of things to keep in mind as we progress, Austin and Berlin ramp inefficiencies will continue to weigh on our margins for the balance of the year. However, the impact should reduce as we increase ramp. Second, as we\u2019ve mentioned before, we expect to continue to see recognized global pricing to increase as our backlog flows through. However, macroeconomic-related cost increases will also continue to be part of our story. And finally, despite losing more builds in Q3 than expected, we are still pushing to reach 50% growth this year. This target has become more difficult, but it remains possible with strong execution and as Elon mentioned, no more force majeure events for the balance of the year.\nElon Musk: Yes, a lot of force majeure in the last several years, that\u2019s for sure.\nZachary Kirkhorn: Thank you.\nA - Martin Viecha: Thank you very much. And now let\u2019s go to the questions from investors. And the first question is, Chinese EV manufacturers seem to be doing a better job than their Western competitors, excluding Tesla, at innovating in software and design. How can Tesla make sure the company is staying ahead of those manufacturers, both within China and outside of China?\nElon Musk: Well, the \u2013 right now, the best Chinese EV manufacturer is Tesla [train] (ph). We are actually doing the best, thanks to our incredible team in China. But I have a lot of respect for the Chinese, our manufacturers and EV manufacturers in particular. I think they will be a force to be reckoned with worldwide. They are very \u2013 they are smart and they are hardworking. And I think anyone who is not \u2013 any company that\u2019s not as competitive as them will obviously suffer a market share decline. So obviously, we have a lot of respect for the current companies in China and then their capabilities, yes.\nMartin Viecha: Thank you. The next question is when will Tesla have a unified vector space for both static and moving object network? Will this be a v11 or later version? If the latter, can you explain what makes it a difficult problem in layman terms?\nElon Musk: Okay. This answer will be understood by 0.0 -- 01% of the audience, I think. I suppose you wanted to know what a unified vector space would actually mean. It essentially would be if you can take \u2013 if instead of netting together static and dynamic objects in C++, if they could be net together at the neural net level, then you don\u2019t need to reconcile them within C++ heuristics. That is an architecturally better way to \u2013 that\u2019s the most desirable outcome. It\u2019s \u2013 I think it\u2019s probably not necessary to achieve full self-driving, but it would be a slight improvement in the efficiency of the self-driving. And it\u2019s certainly something we want to get to. Yes. The sort of nirvana situation is you have surround video/audio labeling of all static and dynamic objects. And you have then surround video inference with spatial memory as well. Then that\u2019s \u2013 I mean, I think we are almost certainly there before the end of the year. Yes, I am not sure how many of you would understand that. I should say also, we are also confident of improving the frame rate as we delete some of the legacy neural nets. We think we might be able to get a frame rate of the \u2013 of 8 [Indiscernible] cameras maybe up to 36 FPS, which is actually a lot of frames, considering it\u2019s 8 cameras. It\u2019s certainly comfortably above 24 frames, which is basically the movie \u2013 frame rate of movies.\nMartin Viecha: Thank you. The next question is Elon recently tweeted about lowering prices once inflation cools down. Can you elaborate on what do you mean by cooling down and how aggressively the company will lower prices? More broadly, how do you think about the auto pricing long-term?\nElon Musk: Yes. So since we have \u2013 there is a quite a long wait when somebody orders in a car, in some cases, 6 months; in some cases, it could be up to a year. We have to anticipate what the probable inflation rate is over that period of time. So that\u2019s what we are trying to do. When we \u2013 when or if we see indications that the inflation rate is declining, then we would not need to increase our car prices. It\u2019s possible that there could be a slight decrease in car prices, but this is fundamentally dependent on macroeconomic inflation. It\u2019s not something we control. If I were to guess and I would take this with a grain of salt, I think inflation will decline towards the end of this year. We are certainly seeing prices of commodities trending lower. Yes, but take it with a grain of salt. This is \u2013 making economic prognostication is fraught with error. I don\u2019t know if you guys want to \u2013 do you want to say anything about...\nAndrew Baglino: Yes. We are certainly seeing, I mean, it\u2019s kind of a whole spectrum. On the battery metal side, for example, the price of lithium has really shot up. We used to be $11 a kilogram to more than $80 a kilogram, but it\u2019s not every situation is that bad so it\u2019s kind of a spectrum.\nLars Moravy: Carbon steel, aluminum, [indiscernible] carbon steel and aluminum has started trending down. We will see the benefits of it only probably later part of this year or early next year.\nElon Musk: Yes. But I think that\u2019s just like for most commodities, we are seeing a downward trend towards the end of this year or next year. Some commodities, the pricing of lithium is insane. I would like to once again urge entrepreneurs to enter the lithium refining business. The mining is relatively easy. The refining is much harder. So, the lithium is actually a very common \u2013 sort of very \u2013 like lithium pretty much everywhere. But you have to refine the lithium into battery-grade lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide, which has to be extremely high purity. So, it is basically like minting money right now. There is like software margins in lithium processing right now. So, I would really like to encourage, once again, entrepreneurs to enter the lithium refining business. You can\u2019t lose. It\u2019s licensed to print money.\nMartin Viecha: Thank you. The next question is you made the right economic call before most on inflation when you diversified into Bitcoin. It has since shown it\u2019s not much of a hedge in the real world test in the last few months. How do you think about it as an asset over long-term and what do you need to see to change your view?\nElon Musk: Well, Tesla is \u2013 Tesla\u2019s goal is to accelerate the advent of sustainable energy. We are not really \u2013 cryptocurrency is a sideshow to the sideshow. So, it\u2019s \u2013 we are not a \u2013 cryptocurrency is not something we think about a lot. We think a lot about scaling production and accelerating the advent of sustainable energy, which the record heat waves around earth, so to emphasize the urgency of that transition. So that is what we are trying to do is make electric vehicles and solar and stationary storage battery packs. But the three pillars of a sustainable energy future, which is like solar and wind for energy generation, stationary battery packs for storage of the solar energy because of its intermittency and then electric vehicles, the third pillar. And if those three things are solved, we have a sustainable future for civilization. And the fundamental good of Tesla and the reason we\u2019re doing this, so certainly, my primary motivation here is to have the day of sustainable energy comes sooner. That\u2019s our goal. We\u2019re neither here nor there on cryptocurrency.\nMartin Viecha: Thank you. The next question on 4680, Elon noted that 4680 plus structural pack is not yet optimized. Can you please share the general path of 4680 in structural packs in terms of cost efficiencies when compared to the traditional 2170 pack? Will cost improvements be mostly due to scale or do we need to solve some technical issues?\nAndrew Baglino: Yes, do you want to do the architecture?\nElon Musk: Yes. So structural pack where we get dual use of the battery cells as structure and as energy storage in the same way that an aircraft gets dual use of the wing as a fuel tank and as a wing is, I think, unequivocally, from a physics standpoint, the superior architecture. It\u2019s the A architecture. Now because it is new, we will start off getting, I don\u2019t know, aspirationally a C within an A architecture. But the potential is there for to get radically better and then unequivocally better than a battery pack, which is carried like a sack of potatoes, so\u2026\nAndrew Baglino: Yes. And we\u2019ve gained the perspective through putting our first structural pack in production that it is actually the A architecture. Like before we did that, it was a hypothesis that was backed with \u2013 I got a lot of modeling and first principles analysis. And now we\u2019ve actually built and are more confident in that assertion.\nElon Musk: Yes. So exactly. So the structural pack, even the C and the A architecture is beating the non-structural pack. And so over time, it will, with further refinement, be substantially superior to that is carrying a battery pack as though it is cargo. And this is like \u2013 it\u2019s very much very analogous to the early days of aviation where fuel tanks were initially carried like cargo until they realized actually, you should get dual use of a fuel tank as a wing and as fuel tank. And that makes the planes lighter and better. And the same is true of electric vehicles.\nMartin Viecha: And on cost improvements, are they due to scale or about solving technical issues?\nElon Musk: Yes. Yes. I mean really, the two things that improve costs are economies of scale and tech and core technology.\nAndrew Baglino: Yes. I think technical issue is not the right.\nElon Musk: Technical issues like\u2026\nAndrew Baglino: Getting to the optimal design, right? Like you always start with some access. Some people might call it that, but that\u2019s not really what you think it is initially. It\u2019s that you don\u2019t know how you can get it until you\u2019ve done it a couple of times.\nElon Musk: Yes. I mean there\u2019s some platonic ideal of the perfect product where the atoms \u2013 you have exactly the right atoms and they are in exactly the right position, and you asymptotically approach this platonic ideal. And \u2013 but it takes a lot of effort over time to figure out actually what is the platonic ideal and then actually gradually approach that.\nAndrew Baglino: Yes. I mean, you might need to create a new alloy, then you need to figure out how to cast it, then you need to ramp the casting machine with the new alloy, as an example\u2026\nElon Musk: We did.\nLars Moravy: We have done it for rudders. We\u2019ve done it for like castings. So, like yes, it does take time.\nAndrew Baglino: Constant improvement is something we are used to here, and it\u2019s something like we\u2019ve done with their vehicles and our design since the beginning. I mean, even we\u2019re talking a couple of weeks ago, like the first version of the front casting that we made that went into the early vehicles is like...\nElon Musk: I mean Model S stage.\nAndrew Baglino: No, I am talking about like our first Model Ys. Since we have ordered more dies because bringing more dies for more production, we\u2019ve saved like 4 or 5 kilos of mass just doing die iteration. And that\u2019s something we do at Tesla like quite regularly and we will continue to do. So we\u2019re not happy with a C, like maybe we are at a C+ now because I think we got to keep going to the tag of B-.\nElon Musk: On the rear casting. But this will transfer for improvement with the casting. So the casting is already way better than the rare body casting is already way better than the \u2013 on the way is done in the past where you\u2019ve got 120 different parts that are welded together or bonded together with different alloys and then you have to put sealant in between all the various parts for water ingress and noise. So we\u2019re already way better than that with current casting, but there\u2019s still a lot of opportunities to reduce the master casting and also extend the casting to include more parts as well as adapt the rest of the vehicle for the fact that there\u2019s a casting.\nAndrew Baglino: Yes, I was going to say the same thing, right? Like we are not just evaluating the pack and insulation either, it\u2019s the pack plus the body, the integration, do we have mass in the right places, we have the cost in the right places and only just the right amount. And I think we\u2019ve gone through one iteration. We\u2019re going to do another one with Cybertruck. I mean, we\u2019re taking the learnings and doing \u2013 the next version hopefully is a B-plus in A architecture. That\u2019s certainly a target.\nMartin Viecha: Thank you. The next question is, how do you feel the progress of FSD is going? And does Andrej Karpathy is leaving have any significant impact on timelines or potential progress?\nElon Musk: Well, since Andrej was writing all the code by himself, naturally, things have come to a grinding halt. It\u2019s irony. So, Andrej is also [indiscernible] of Chris, my respect for Andrej. He has decided to \u2013 I think he wants to contribute more to I think, core AI at an academic level and get back to coding individually. But we\u2019ve got a team of about 120 people in our software AI group that are extremely talented. And I think we will have \u2013 I\u2019m highly confident we will solve full self-driving and it still seems to be this year. I know people are like says that. But it does seem to be epic. It does seem as though we are converging on solving full self-driving this year.\nMartin Viecha: Thank you. The next question is, how is the 4680 ramp going? And is Giga Texas producing cells yet?\nAndrew Baglino: Yes. So we are making progress on 4680. But right now, as Elon mentioned, we are leveraging supplier cells, which we have in sufficient quantity to ramp Texas and Berlin. We expect to ramp total 4680 production to exceed 1,000 per week by the end of the year, hopefully before \u2013 well before. In Q2, at Kato, we fully automated [indiscernible] for the drying of electrode tool there, unlocking major increases in production and improvements in yields. Since March because of that, Kato output has grown about 35% month-over-month each month since, and yields throughout the factory are already at targets in most areas and trending in that direction and a few others. We did feed learnings from Fremont cell and pack lines to Texas and Berlin there, a carbon copy. Cell design was revved to unlock higher performance and manufacturing simplicity. Manufacturing lines were further integrated and we in-sourced additional content. For these reasons, there are some new ramp challenges to overcome in Texas and Berlin. Specific to Texas last quarter, cell equipment was fully installed and commissioned and we produced our first commissioning car sets of cells through the end of the line. Our target for Texas is to begin production this quarter and aim for Texas to be capable of exceeding Kato weekly output before the end of this year.\nMartin Viecha: Thank you very much. The next question is on 4680 as well, but I think Drew has covered everything that was in the next question. So the following question is with regards to the ramp of production in Austin and Berlin. How is the situation with regards to supply of semiconductors, battery cells and other components? How about cost inflation impacting profitability of these other plants?\nAndrew Baglino: I can take that. So Tesla procures about 1,600 unique pieces of silicon from 43 semiconductor companies. So with a portfolio of that size, there are always challenges. Things are more stable on the latest generation chips. We still see some tightness in the older generation semiconductors, especially in the analog and mixed signal space. But we have line of sight to solve for the volumes being contemplated for both Austin and Berlin. And on the cell front, like Elon mentioned, we have a comfortable margin, thanks to record output from our partners and have line of sight that matches the planned output from both factories. We\u2019ve grown cell production significantly on a 12-month rolling basis and have long-term contracts with all our partners for key battery metals. So we don\u2019t see any major problems for the components, of course, barring unforeseen COVID-related shutdowns.\nZachary Kirkhorn: Just to add on the profitability part of the question. Q2 was our largest increase yet over the last handful of quarters on inflation and commodity-related increases to our cars. It\u2019s fairly evenly spread across the factories, given common suppliers or common issues that impact the broad supply chain. So I think I had mentioned before that we have been seeing increases over the course of last year. It ticked up in Q1 and then it ticked up again at the rate of increase was more in Q2. So as we look through to the end of the year, what we\u2019re seeing is we don\u2019t think the inflation-related increases in Q3 will be as big as Q2. But as Elon had mentioned, there is uncertainty on pricing here. And we don\u2019t have full exposure, as Karan had just mentioned, on every component of cost because we do have some contracts in place. But there are some spot buys as well and some contracts being renegotiated. So we\u2019re managing it with pricing and in partnership with our suppliers but it does continue to be something that is impacting our financials.\nMartin Viecha: Thank you very much. And the last question is, when will the Cybertruck be officially available?\nElon Musk: We\u2019re hoping to start delivering them in the middle of next year.\nMartin Viecha: Great. Thank you very much. And now let\u2019s go to analyst questions. The first question comes from Pierre Ferragu from New Street Research. Pierre, feel free to unmute yourself.\nPierre Ferragu: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I\u2019d like to ask like a question on 4680 and the structural battery pack. And I\u2019d love to understand where you stand on the technology and efficiency and energy density road map that you described at the Battery Day. So what I\u2019m trying to understand is where do you stand on the architecture of the battery cell itself? How much silicon do you have in it? How much energy improvement have you achieved already so far? Sorry. And the reason why I\u2019m asking \u2013 sorry.\nAndrew Baglino: Go ahead.\nPierre Ferragu: And the reason why I\u2019m asking that is because you have like very smart guys on Twitter who shared experience about trying to fully empty a Model Y from Texas from Austin and noticing behaviors and like recharging behavior that suggested that maybe these cars had like very, very high mileage, very high range, and were like artificially limited in range in software. So I\u2019m just kind of trying to understand how much of an edge you\u2019re building at the moment with the 4680 and the battery back on range.\nAndrew Baglino: Yes. Let me just try to provide like a super straightforward answer, like as Elon mentioned before, our priority was really on simplicity and scale during the initial 4680 and structural battery ramp. So we weren\u2019t like putting all the bells and whistles in from day 1 because if so, we would be sort of suffering under a string of serious miracles that we would need to achieve to get going. But as we attain the manufacturing goals that we\u2019ve stated at the ramp that we need to hit next year, we are certainly planning to layer in new material technologies and higher-range structural packs, but like holding back goodies for some rainy day or something like that.\nElon Musk: Yes. Maybe another way of putting it is that the \u2013 our focus right now is on the dozens of little issues that inhibit the production ramp of the 4680. Some of the more challenging ones have been feeding the anode-cathode material because we\u2019re using this revolutionary dry electrode process. But when something is revolutionary, it\u2019s a lot of unknowns that have to be resolved. So we\u2019re confident of resolving those unknowns but it\u2019s very difficult. It\u2019s \u2013 yes, we\u2019re making rapid progress on that point. So the first order of business is really get the basics right, get to high volume and high reliability and then very rapidly iterate within that to enhance the energy density and reduce the cost of the cell.\nAndrew Baglino: Totally agree, yes.\nPierre Ferragu: Okay.\nElon Musk: I\u2019d say we are highly confident of a good outcome. It\u2019s the exact counterpoint of that is perhaps is of some debate but the outcome is not.\nAndrew Baglino: Yes. Specific to the dry process, we made a major advance this past quarter in Kato that the team is really excited about, and congrats to the team for achieving that.\nElon Musk: But I should also emphasize that it is not as though Tesla intends to displace our suppliers of battery cells. The Tesla battery cell production is in addition to what our suppliers can do. And we want our suppliers to grow their battery output as fast as they possibly can, and that goes for the entire supply chain. The fundamental rate limiter for both transitioning to sustainable energy is how fast can you grow with the amount battery output per year? This is the fundamental rate limiter for transition to sustainability because you need the batteries for two of the pillars of sustainability, the stationary storage and for vehicles. So yes.\nAndrew Baglino: Yes, I just want to stress that a lot of these higher energy density technologies are not necessarily scalable. I mean, most of them are not scalable from what I\u2019ve seen. And so like focusing on them is a distraction from the mission, like it really is how do we scale as fast as possible? And we\u2019re taking these risks that we\u2019ve discussed at Battery Day. And our plan is as we de-risk them and they are successful, we want to bring them back to our partners so that they can go faster, too, because that\u2019s all on the mission, right, like how do we accelerate.\nElon Musk: People often ask me, if you often ask me, is some breakthrough needed in battery technology for the world to transition to sustainability? The answer is no. Even if there was zero technology breakthroughs, so literally zero from where the technology is right now, we could fully transition Earth to sustainable energy. The issue is very much the rate at which the entire supply chain from mining to refining to cell production. How fast can that grow? It\u2019s growing fast with the faster it grows, the faster we transition to a sustainable energy economy.\nPierre Ferragu: This is actually a great exactly where my follow-up is. So Elon, you always mention this 50% per annum sustainable growth target that you guys have. And so my question here is when we see like the difficulty regarding the commodities, raw materials, swinging prices, I\u2019m kind of wondering, as you are planning for this 50% per annum growth, if we stand today over the next 5 to 10 years, how much of that do you feel you\u2019ve secured through your work at entering into long-term contracts and things like that? And you were calling for entrepreneurs to go into the lithium business. So does that mean you don\u2019t have enough lithium secured to grow 50% per annum over multiple years? And what\u2019s \u2013 how much of that is secured today? And how fast can you improve that basically?\nElon Musk: Well, I think it\u2019s very difficult to predict anything 10 years from now. I hope civilization is still around, frankly. I don\u2019t count that as a win.\nPierre Ferragu: Not that fun.\nElon Musk: Yes, exactly. Hopefully, we haven\u2019t had World War 3 by then. Yes. So the \u2013 we do see constraints in refining of the materials necessary for lithium ion batteries. I do want to emphasize this as \u2013 it is not due to a scarcity of the raw material. In the case of lithium, lithium is one of the most common elements on earth. It\u2019s pretty much everywhere. But refining of the lithium into ultra-high purity battery-grade lithium hydroxide, lithium carbonate is quite difficult and requires a massive amount of machinery and it\u2019s a hard thing to scale. As it was also difficult to create the anode and cathode, I think \u2013 my guess is maybe two-thirds of batteries will be iron phosphate or maybe iron phosphate with some manganese. And there is plenty of \u2013 there is a ridiculous amount of iron with it. In fact earth is \u2013 a little better of trivia says, what is earth made of more than anything else, iron. Iron is the number one ingredient of earth by mass, number two is oxygen, which is wild. Yes. Basically rust. Actually, we are stuck together. We are a rust ball. That\u2019s roughly \u2013 that\u2019s almost two-thirds of earth, I think is rust. We are like a rusty ball bearing with a little bit of other stuff, so \u2013 but plenty of lithium. So anyway, there is not like a shortage of materials.\nAndrew Baglino: Yes. I mean but the other thing on the LFP thing is that it isn\u2019t just that there is more access to material that way. The actual refining process is less capital intensive to make a good LFP cathode. And so there is \u2013 it\u2019s not just scalable on the resource side, it\u2019s scalable on the refining side.\nElon Musk: Okay. Absolutely, to clear, there is no fundamental barrier here. It\u2019s simply a rate question. Like at what rate can you scale production, and I think we are seeing a very rapid increase in battery production and in the whole supply chain. If you were to say today, what are concerns appears down the road, I would say one of the concerns is the machinery to refine the critical ingredients of lithium ion cells. So, the lithium itself and then the cathode, which I said like I said, will be mostly iron phosphate, actually some manganese. I think almost all stationary storage will be iron phosphate and then you really just need nickel chemistry for long-range vehicles and like aircraft and that kind of thing.\nAndrew Baglino: Yes. The other thing I would say is \u2013 we are working with our suppliers to ramp their capability as quickly as possible. And it\u2019s not like we have a problem in the next year or 2 years to \u2013 specifically to your question. But when we look 10 years out, yes, we need to do more to accelerate the growth. And that is why we are making our own investments, like we are building a facility here in Texas. This already is going up, you can see it in the flyovers. We are working on a lithium refining activity as well ourselves because the best way to learn how to accelerate something is to do it yourself. So, these are the things we are doing to move it all forward.\nElon Musk: Yes. If our suppliers don\u2019t solve these problems, then we will.\nMartin Viecha: Thank you. The next question comes from Emmanuel Rosner from Deutsche Bank. Emmanuel, go ahead and un-mute yourself.\nEmmanuel Rosner: Yes. Thank you so much. I have a question on your vehicle demand and then a quick follow-up on supply. First, on the demand side. Are you seeing any sort of pressure in the order book or the pace of new order or any sort of like slowdown as a result of the pressures that the consumer is experiencing? Are you worried about it in light of your view of the risks to the economy that I think you expressed, Elon?\nElon Musk: Well, right now, our firm is very much production. So, we have long leads on \u2013 as anyone can tell, if they order our car, if you order Model Y, it will arrive sometime next year. So, this is clearly not an issue for many months for us. Our problem is overwhelmingly that of production. So, yes.\nZachary Kirkhorn: Okay. Maybe just two things to add. Specifically on your question, are we seeing a macroeconomic impact on our demand, not that I can tell. Maybe a little.\nElon Musk: Some maybe.\nZachary Kirkhorn: But it\u2019s not material. The second thing to Elon\u2019s point about backlogs, we have a very long runway with very long lead times here. I mean certainly, the world is uncertain and we will have to see where things go with commodity prices, how quickly we are ramping production, what the state of the road looks like at some point next year. But the demand is not something we spend really any time talking about.\nElon Musk: Yes. I think it\u2019s \u2013 maybe just one thing worth mentioning the \u2013 that there is surface between value for money and fundamental affordability because sometimes people say, \u201cWell, if you got all this demand, why don\u2019t you just raise the price to some \u2013 double the price or something?\u201d And this is usually expressed by somebody who is rich. But there is \u2013 even if you rail value for money to infinity, if somebody does a little bit, concerns do not have enough money to buy it, even a product where the desirability is rail to infinity, they basically cannot buy it. So, this is why you kind of just raise prices to some arbitrarily high level because you pass the affordability boundary and then the demand falls off a cliff. So, I do feel like we have raised our prices or we raise the price quite a few times. They are frankly at embarrassing levels. But we have also had a lot of supply chain and production trucks and as we have got crazy inflation. So, I am hopeful, this is not a promise or anything, but I am hopeful that at some point, we can reduce the prices a little bit.\nMartin Viecha: Thank you. Emmanuel, do you have a follow-up?\nEmmanuel Rosner: Yes. My follow-up was actually on the supply side. So, it was very encouraging to see that you are quantifying your current installed capacity at basically already in excess of 1.9 million units installed currently. How quickly do you think that you can fill that capacity?\nElon Musk: Well, I mean we \u2013 I think we have got a good chance of exiting this year at 40,000 vehicles a week.\nAndrew Baglino: Yes. I mean our internal plans are to have the capacity utilized by the end of the year. It takes time to ramp there. It will be a challenge. There is a lot that needs to happen to get there, but that\u2019s what we are working on.\nElon Musk: Yes. We have had many 30,000-car weeks already, so I think a 40,000-car week is within reach by the end of this year.\nAndrew Baglino: Shanghai and Fremont, as we said last month for record production and they are really fire to better doing really well. But then also Berlin are coming on strong. Theoretically, they also had record quarters last quarter. And if we ramp them to the capacity shown in the deck by the end of this year, we will be at that rate.\nElon Musk: There is always a lot of uncertainty like the production looks like ESCO [ph], and that intermediate part of ESCO, it\u2019s very difficult to bridge that with high certainty. But the end part of the ESCO, you can say, I think you can have a lot more certainty. And so that\u2019s why I am confident we will get to 5,000 cars a week at \u2013 in Austin and Berlin by the end of this year or early next year and probably but not certainly, 10,000 cars a week at both locations by the end of next year.\nMartin Viecha: Thank you. The next question comes from Colin Rusch from Oppenheimer. Colin, go ahead please.\nColin Rusch: Thanks so much, guys. Could you talk a little bit about the pricing strategy around FSD, and as you get closer to this full functionality rolling out and the increased cycle times, how you see that evolving through the balance of this year and into 2023?\nElon Musk: Yes. We will increase the price of FSD sometime later this year. I think probably just before we go to quiet Beta or Beta is anyone who wants to use the Beta software with all the caveats associated with that can use it. Then it would make sense to increase the price of FSD. The value of FSD is, I think extremely high and not well understood by most people. It is basically currently ridiculously cheap, assuming FSD materializes, which is well.\nColin Rusch: Great. And then sorry to belabor a little bit on battery materials side. But in terms of some of the suppliers and the contaminants, can you be a little bit more specific around some of the elements that you guys see in some of your supply chain that can prove troublesome yields for the 4680s, particularly around lithium and potential contaminants in either hydroxide, the carbonates that you guys end up seeing real issues with as you move into production?\nZachary Kirkhorn: Yes. I don\u2019t really think we have anything to comment on, yes, the purity specs of lithium on this call right now, yes.\nElon Musk: Yes. The contaminants from the 4680 are not a factor, which is not an issue.\nMartin Viecha: Okay. Thank you very much. The next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi from Bernstein. Tony, go ahead please.\nToni Sacconaghi: Yes. Thank you for taking my question. I have two as well. In response to the question around demand, I think Zach, you said maybe a little, and Elon, you said maybe some indication that you might see some pressure on demand. And I am wondering if that is really just speculation or whether there is any empirical data that you saw in the last month, whether it would be cancellations or order lead times that led you to make that comment. I think anecdotally, if you squint, the lead times have gotten a little lower over the last four months in both China and the U.S. That\u2019s really the only visibility investors have. So, I am wondering if you could maybe elaborate on whether that\u2019s really just you are sort of anticipating there could be some impact because of high prices or whether they are something anecdotally or quantitatively that you could point to, please?\nElon Musk: No. I mean I think we have said this now for many years, I know has proven true. Tesla does not have a demand problem, we have a production problem. And we have almost always had it\u2019s a very rare exception it\u2019s always been a production problem. I think that will remain the case.\nToni Sacconaghi: So, there is a denominator and a numerator and like, you increase production?\nElon Musk: Yes, absolutely. As we increase production, more demand is needed obviously.\nAndrew Baglino: No, it\u2019s more just like you can\u2019t look at the backlog and state much about demand because we are doing a lot on the other side to change the production.\nElon Musk: We are trying to make the backlog lower, not longer.\nAndrew Baglino: Building factories and building more\u2026\nElon Musk: We don\u2019t want a long backlog. That\u2019s annoying. It would be like go to a restaurant and you order a burger and you have to wait three hours and like, that\u2019s annoying. You want to get your burger right away. Same with the car. So, we want that lead times to reduce.\nToni Sacconaghi: Okay. Thank you. Now I was just trying to follow-up on the fact that you both said that maybe we are seeing demand be impacted a little bit, and that was the spirit of the question, maybe...\nElon Musk: We don\u2019t have like \u2013 like because we see daily orders from around the world for our cars, it\u2019s actually \u2013 it is like a mood barometer of people\u2019s confidence in the economy. But one can\u2019t read too much into it because things can vary a great deal from one day to the next. Consumer sentiment is all over the map. So, it\u2019s \u2013 manage price, frankly. But we have so much excess demand. That is really just not an issue for us. It might be an issue for some other companies but it is not an issue for us.\nToni Sacconaghi: Okay. Thank you. Elon, I am just wondering, a question for you. Tesla has obviously changed dramatically in the last 3 years from near life or death to a company with consistent cash flow and industry-leading margins. I am wondering if you can comment on your personal role in the company and whether you see that changing in terms of your role, your commitment and time spent at the company over the next 3 years or 4 years. I think you said a few calls ago, you wouldn\u2019t be on calls unless there is something unusual and you have been on every call since then. I am wondering how...\nElon Musk: I do a lot of unusual things, let\u2019s face it. Basically, if there is only good news, I won\u2019t be on the call. But if you have like a tough situation like COVID shutdowns in China, then I think I will be on the call \u2013 relatively speaking, if there is bad news. And we have this good news, then I won\u2019t be on the call. But I am committed to the long \u2013 I mean I will work at Tesla as long as I can usefully advance the cause of sustainability and autonomy.\nMartin Viecha: Fantastic. Thank you very much. The next question comes from William Stein. Please go ahead and un-mute yourself.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Thank you very much for taking my question. Elon, in the past, you have given some assessment as to the likelihood that you can achieve success in some of the more interesting AI-oriented efforts, not only FSD, but also Dojo and Optimus. Perhaps you can give an updated view on those.\nElon Musk: Well, I don\u2019t want to steal thunder from AI Day. So, I think we will have some exciting news on AI Day that I think will be further ahead than probably most people think. But I don\u2019t want to \u2013 I would love to answer you, but I think we will leave that excitement for AI Day.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. And perhaps a follow-up if I can. We have heard a lot from others and certainly to some degree from you all about the shortages in semiconductors, in particular. We have seen some big, important customers of that type of product decide to sort of leverage the ecosystems that exist to make some of their own in those categories. I am wondering to what degree you are doing that. That\u2019s outside of Dojo in terms of the \u2013 I guess on the inference side, you are certainly doing that in the car, but what about sort of the more mundane areas like microcontrollers and the like? Is there any internal effort to improve supply chain and maybe improve other performance aspects?\nElon Musk: Well, there is what we have done, we have been working with our suppliers side. We don\u2019t currently intend to make chips ourselves. We don\u2019t think there will be a need to make chips, but we have been working closely with a number of suppliers. Actually just met with one of our key supplier CEOs right before this call. We had a great meeting. They are going to make major investments in some of the critical chips and components that we need in the car. And I would actually like to take a moment to thank our key suppliers once again for supporting us through difficult times. And they really went above and beyond to support us. So, to all our suppliers out there, thanks very much.\nAndrew Baglino: Yes. And I guess just maybe we don\u2019t talk about it very often, but we do have a lot of custom silicon in the vehicle already. Microcontrollers, yes, some, battery management, yes, some, power electronics, yes, some. So, we try to go after where there is actually a technical advantage. And in the future, I think we are going to look at where there is a supplier\u2026\nElon Musk: Even now where there are supply chain issues with our Tier 1s and Tier 2s, get into it with us on the engineering side when we find solutions, whether it\u2019s alternative chips or changing the entire structure of this pack to make it work. And I think that\u2019s an advantage we have that many other OEs just simply cannot. I think Tesla is as much a software company as it is a hardware company. And so one of the ways that we have been able to address supply chain issues on the chip front is by rewriting software to be able to use different chips, or in some cases, achieve dual use of a single chip, which is even better. And actually, quite frankly, the chip shortage has served as a forcing function for us to reduce the number of chips in the car. Yes, turns out we had more chips than we needed. But that\u2019s a testament to our software team that we are able to roll a new chip into the car, write a whole new patch of software for that chip and \u2013 without interrupting production.\nAndrew Baglino: Yes. And our goal is as we mature and scale the platforms to integrate more functionality into fewer chips, like that is the way that it\u2019s gone with laptops and phones. It\u2019s going that way in cars. And we are trying to do that wherever it makes sense to do it as quickly as we can.\nElon Musk: From a supply chain standpoint, do we \u2013 what do you think about the chips and whatnot?\nAndrew Baglino: Yes. I think \u2013 I mean from a high level, instead of designing and building our own microcontrollers, we are partnering with key partners that understand the architectural requirements and they will take the specs and design something for us. We have done that, to your point, Drew, on the battery sensing space. We have got some application-specific ICs. But yes, integrating, reducing the number of components, it makes supply chain easier, but it also makes the reliability of the end product better because there is less failure points. So, that\u2019s always been the mantra.\nLars Moravy: And at times, we have also got the wafer level and try to consume less to achieve the same functionality. So, that\u2019s something also that we have been looking at in some of the constrained modules that we have faced in the last six months.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you.\nMartin Viecha: Fantastic. Well, thank you very much. I appreciate all of your questions. Unfortunately, this is all the time we have this quarter, and we will speak to you again in three months\u2019 time. Thank you very much, and goodbye.\nElon Musk: Bye."}, {"symbol": "TSLA", "quarter": 1, "year": 2022, "date": "2022-04-20 21:44:03", "content": "Martin Viecha: Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Tesla\u2019s First Quarter 2022 Q&A Webcast. My name is Martin Viecha, VP of Investor Relations, and I\u2019m joined today by Elon Musk, Zachary Kirkhorn and a number of other executives. Our Q1 results were announced at about 3 p.m. Central Time in the update deck we published at the same link as this webcast. During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events and results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC. During the question-and-answer portion of today\u2019s call, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Please use the Raise Hand button to join the question queue. Before we jump into Q&A, Zach will have some opening remarks. Zach\nZachary Kirkhorn: Yes. Thanks, Martin. Just to start off here, Q1 was a challenging but extremely successful quarter for the Company. Despite numerous supply interruptions, including shuts at our Shanghai factory and nearby suppliers due to COVID, we\u2019ve continued making progress and achieved our best-ever vehicle deliveries. Last quarter, we demonstrated a series of new financial records, including revenue, gross margins, operating margin and bottom line profitability. GAAP automotive gross margin reached 32.9% and first time exceeded 30% when excluding regulatory credits. Higher pricing continues to positively impact our financials as we make progress delivering cars and our growing backlog. Note that, for most vehicles, our delivery wait times are quite long. Thus, cars delivered in Q1 generally carried pricing set in prior quarters and at levels lower than cars being ordered today. Our per unit vehicle cost increased as well. Inflation, raw material prices, expedite and logistics costs continues to impact our cost structure. Factory shutdowns also occurred with little to no notice. Hence, we are unable to take action to plan those interruptions in a cost-efficient manner. Additionally, we saw a slight mix shift towards more profitable vehicles, including the Model Y. We also recognized a onetime benefit of $288 million from credit revenue relating to a regulatory change in the U.S. CAFE penalty, without of which credit revenue would have declined compared to the same period last year. The energy business has continued to be impacted by macro conditions, more severely than the vehicle business. Our storage products, our need of chip supply and new import processes have impacted supply of certain components for our solar systems, which is reflected in our solar volume for the quarter. OpEx as a percentage of revenue continues to reduce, driven by higher revenue, lower stock-based comp expense and other items. As a result of our ongoing improvements in operating leverage, we achieved a record operating margin of over 19%. Note that commissioning costs for our factories are in R&D as Berlin started production in late March and Austin in early April. These costs will be in automotive costs going forward, given these factories are now producing customer sellable cars. Our free cash flows have remained quite strong, yet were impacted by working capital related to lower-than-planned production. Additionally, we have reduced our debt, excluding product financing, to nearly zero. Looking ahead in the immediate term, a few things to keep in mind for Q2. First, we\u2019ve lost about a month of build volume out of our factory in Shanghai due to COVID-related shutdowns. Production is resuming at limited levels, and we\u2019re working to get back to full production as quickly as possible. This will impact total build and delivery volume in Q2. Second, as I\u2019ve mentioned before, Austin and Berlin are just starting their ramps. And thus, those inefficiencies will start to flow through our gross margins in Q2. Third, we do have higher ASPs in our backlog, which will help to offset some of these headwinds. We continue to drive towards further strengthening of our financials in the second half of the year and believe our 50% or above growth rate remains achievable for the year. I want to conclude by thanking the Tesla team, our suppliers and our new customers for a great first quarter.\nMartin Viecha: Thank you very much. And Elon has some opening remarks as well.\nElon Musk: Sure. Some of my remarks will be redundant with Zach\u2019s, but it\u2019s maybe worth repeating. Q1 was once again a record quarter on many levels, by reaching the highest deliveries, profit and an operating margin of 19%. This was despite a lot of chip shortages, many logistics challenges and an overall difficult quarter. So, I\u2019d really like to congratulate the Tesla team on achieving record profitability and output despite many, many difficult headwinds, and especially the Tesla China team in our Shanghai factory. They really had significant challenges due to the COVID shutdown and nonetheless have been able to output a tremendous number of high-quality vehicles. And we are already back up and running with the Shanghai factory. So, as Zach said, we remain confident of a 50% growth in vehicle production in 2022 versus \u201821. I think, we actually have a reasonable shot at a 60% increase over last year. So, let\u2019s see. Obviously, we ramped production, as you will know, with Giga Berlin and Giga Texas in the past few months. So, with two fantastic factories with great teams, and they are ramping rapidly. Now, with new factories, the initial ramp always looks small, but it grows exponentially. So, I have very high confidence in the teams of both factories. And we expect to ramp those initially slowly, but like I said, growing exponentially with them achieving high volume by the end of this year. So, we\u2019re also working on a new vehicle that I alluded to at the Giga Texas opening, which is a dedicated robotaxi. That\u2019s highly optimized for autonomy, meaning it would not have steering wheel or pedals. And there are a number of other innovations around it that I think are quite exciting. That is fundamentally optimized for -- trying to achieve the lowest fully considered cost per mile or cost per kilometer, accounting everything. And so, it\u2019s, I think, going to be a very powerful product where we aspire to reach volume production of that in 2024. So, I think that really will be a massive driver of Tesla\u2019s growth. And we remain on track to reach volume production of the Cybertruck next year. So, it\u2019s basically -- once again, I\u2019d like to thank the Tesla employees for their hard work, but also I\u2019d like to thank our suppliers who\u2019ve really gone the extra mile. They -- we have an amazing supplier group, and I want say heartfelt thanks to the suppliers that have really worked day and night to ensure that Tesla is able to keep the factories running. And we\u2019re really at the early stage of that journey. We only crossed 1 million units in the past 12 months recently. And we are -- we aspire to head to 20 million units a year. So, we\u2019re basically 5% along the way towards our goal. And we are growing very, very rapidly year-over-year. And we remain confident of exceeding 50% annual growth for the foreseeable future for basically several of the next years, I mean, so yes. And then, there\u2019s, of course, Optimus, which I was surprised that people did not realize the magnitude of the Optimus robot program. The importance of Optimus will become apparent in coming years. Those who are insightful or listen carefully will understand that Optimus ultimately will be worth more than the car business, worth more than FSD. That\u2019s my firm belief. So -- and then, of course, insurance is growing well. We expect to address the part shortages that limited our progress with batteries and solar. So, we expect batteries and solar to also grow well this year. And basically, the future is very exciting. I\u2019ve never been more optimistic or excited about Tesla\u2019s future than I am right now. Thank you.\nA - Martin Viecha: Thank you very much. Let\u2019s go to first investor question. And the first investor question is, Elon has historically provided FSD time lines with not optimal accuracy. We love his optimism for 2022 release, but is there any data Tesla can share with investors to help them make their own conclusions on progress being made? Interventions per mile driven, or any other data?\nElon Musk: Sure. Well, with respect to full self-driving, of any technology development I\u2019ve ever been involved in, I\u2019ve never really seen more kind of false dawns or where it seems like we\u2019re going to break through, but we don\u2019t, as I\u2019ve seen in full self-driving. And ultimately, what it comes down to is that to solve full self-driving, you actually have to solve real-world artificial intelligence, which is -- which nobody has solved. The whole road system is made for biological neural nets and eyes. And so, actually, when you think about it, in order to solve for full self-driving, we have to solve neural nets and cameras to a degree of capability that is on par with or really exceeds humans. And I think we will achieve that this year. The best way to reach your own assessment is to join the Tesla full self-driving beta program where we have over 100,000 people right now enrolled in that program, and we expect to broaden that significantly this year. So, that\u2019s my recommendation, is join the full self-driving beta program and experience it for yourself and take note of the rate of improvement with every release. And we put out a new release roughly every two weeks. And you\u2019ll see a little bit of two steps forward, one step back. But overall, the rate of improvement is incredibly quick. So, that\u2019s my recommendation for reaching your own assessment is literally try it.\nMartin Viecha: Thank you. The second question is, how much of an impact will the production shutdown in Shanghai have in Q2? What is the time line for localizing the Model 3 in Europe, or will newer models be prioritized in Berlin?\nElon Musk: Well, we did lose a lot of important days of production. And because there are sort of upstream supplier challenges where a lot of suppliers also have lost many days of production. But Tesla Shanghai -- Giga Shanghai is coming back with a vengeance. So, I think notwithstanding new issues that arise, I think we will see record output per week from Giga Shanghai this quarter, albeit we are missing a couple of weeks. So, that means the most likely vehicle production in Q2 will be similar to Q1, maybe slightly lower, but it\u2019s also possible we may pull a rabbit out of the hat and be slightly higher. But it\u2019s really, call it, roughly on par. But then, Q3 and Q4 will be substantially higher. So, it seems likely that we\u2019ll be able to produce over 1.5 million cars this year is my -- that\u2019s my best guess. And then, Model 3. It\u2019s important for new factories to be focused on -- and have the least amount of complexity and variation, which is why Giga Berlin and Giga Texas are focused on the Model Y. It\u2019s -- from the point in which you have a factory complete and you\u2019re making a small number of units to the point where it\u2019s producing high-quality vehicles in volume is sort of 9 to 12 months from start of production. So, now hopefully, we\u2019re getting better at that ramp, so maybe it\u2019s a little less. But to get to sort of the 5,000 a week level has typically taken us around 12 months from start of production.\nMartin Viecha: Thank you. The next question is, how much raw material exposure do you have, measured roughly in percentage of cost of goods sold for example, in a given quarter versus one to two years out, both direct and indirect? Separately, how do you think about price increases versus prioritizing higher mix vehicles going forward?\nElon Musk: Actually, on the price increase front, I should mention that it may seem like maybe we\u2019re being unreasonable about increasing the prices of our vehicles, given that we had record profitability this quarter, but the wait list for our vehicles is quite long. And some of the vehicles that people will order, the wait list extends into next year. So, our prices of vehicles ordered now are really anticipating supplier and logistics cost growth that we\u2019re aware of and believe will happen over the next 6 to 12 months. So, that\u2019s why we have the price increases today because the car ordered today will arrive, in some cases, a year from now. So, we have a very long wait list, and we\u2019re obviously not demand-limited. We are production-limited by -- very much production-limited.\nMartin Viecha: Raw material exposure?\nZachary Kirkhorn: Yes. Just to add to what Elon is saying, there\u2019s different ways to calculate raw material exposure. I think the simple way, we estimate we\u2019re around 10% to 15% of our cost structure exposed to raw materials. And just to clarify a couple of things on that. So, we\u2019ve been experiencing increases in cost in general, but also raw materials for a number of quarters now. That pace picked up in Q1, so last quarter. And what we\u2019re seeing for Q2 is slightly higher than that as well. And as indices move, it doesn\u2019t impact us immediately or directly. In some cases, we have contracts with suppliers. But then as those contracts expire, we have to renegotiate them so that there can be a lag. In some cases, our contracts do directly reflect movement in commodity prices or raw material prices. But the timing in which that Tesla pays for that has a lag associated with it as well based on the contract. And so, to Elon\u2019s point, what we\u2019re trying to do here, because it\u2019s quite an unprecedented situation of raw material movement and all of these various lags and uncertainty around renegotiating contracts, is we\u2019re trying to anticipate where things will go and make sure the pricing that we have put in place at the time that those raw material cost increases hit us that they align and that the company can remain financially healthy in various scenarios as we look out over the next four quarters.\nMartin Viecha: Okay. Thank you very much. The next question is, why does Tesla continue to fight dealership laws on a state-by-state basis versus taking it federal? Separately, why isn\u2019t Tesla using 800-volt architecture in its vehicles? What are the advantages or disadvantages?\nElon Musk: So, from Tesla\u2019s standpoint, obviously, we\u2019d like to have federal legislation that allows direct sales in all states, but we have not seen willingness on the part of the Congress to enact such law that would override a variety of state laws. So unfortunately, we have to fight it on a state-by-state basis. And Drew, do you want to answer the 800-volt question?\nAndrew Baglino: Yes, sure. On the 800-volt thing, yes, so it\u2019s really a case-by-case thing. For the smaller platform vehicles like 3 and Y, there\u2019s some wins and losses with 800 volts, not everything is better. And so, we look at that platform, and we\u2019re not like ignoring the reality that you can go to a higher voltage, but there\u2019s nothing really encouraging us to do so on that platform. It\u2019s really about mass and power. And as you look at bigger vehicles, there are some advantages on those bigger vehicles.\nElon Musk: Let me just quantify that. Basically, our estimate is that going from 400 to 800 volts might save $100. It\u2019s not really moving the needle.\nAndrew Baglino: And you\u2019re changing many things. It\u2019s charging infrastructure all the way through the entire vehicle system to get maybe $100.\nElon Musk: Yes, exactly. So I mean, in the U.S., you\u2019ve got 110-volt household power -- or voltage. And then, in your most -- like sort of 220. But really, it doesn\u2019t make that much of a difference, and appliances work pretty much as well in, say, Europe as they do in the U.S. So, there\u2019s some -- the advantages are small and the cost is high. Like I said, it\u2019s long-term, like years now, it makes sense probably to an 800-volt architecture probably, but it really needs a very big vehicle volume to pay for the cost of changing from 400 to 800 volts. And then, Drew, do you want to continue to with it?\nAndrew Baglino: I was just going to say that 100 volts is also kind of like a spreadsheet exercise, right?\nElon Musk: $100.\nAndrew Baglino: Sorry. $100. It\u2019s roughly like a spreadsheet exercise, like you have to get through the full program to the end to see that maybe it\u2019s been whittled away to $50 or less. On bigger vehicles, where you\u2019re talking about higher power on the charging side or higher power from the battery to the power electronics or you need more torque, so the current requirements go up, there\u2019s a little bit more semiconductor and actual conductor savings of going to the higher voltage. And so, we do consider that for Semi and Cybertruck. But for the 3/Y platform where we\u2019ve got everything running and the benefit is questionably small.\nElon Musk: Yes. It\u2019s basically zero for robotaxi.\nAndrew Baglino: Yes. For robotaxi, yes, it doesn\u2019t make sense.\nElon Musk: No, no. Sorry, this...\nAndrew Baglino: Sounds good.\nMartin Viecha: Okay. Let\u2019s go to the next question. Next question is, how are the current 4680s performing versus expectations set during the Battery Day in terms of expected range increase and dollars per kilowatt hour?\nElon Musk: Yes.\nAndrew Baglino: Yes. We\u2019re working in all the areas we shared on Battery Day, and we have sort of consistent progress across all of those areas towards achieving the five-year cost trajectory goals for the cost within our control, but we do not control all the commodity costs. So, that\u2019s an exception I needed to call out. Similar to Model 3, it will take us several years to get rate and yields to the point where everything that we\u2019ve discussed is achieved. Our priority was on simplicity and scale during our initial 4680 and structural battery ramps. And as we attain our manufacturing goals, we will layer in new material technologies we are developing and higher-range structural pack provisions.\nElon Musk: I think maybe, in a nutshell, I think it probably is fair to say that 4680 and structural pack will be competitive with the best alternatives later this year. And we think we\u2019ll exceed the best alternatives next year.\nAndrew Baglino: Yes. I mean we have some good existing proofs, right? Like we\u2019ve built the facility here in Texas, like we know how much we spent on capital equipment in the facility. And it\u2019s more than 5x less than prior technology installations. So, we\u2019re saving huge on CapEx, on utilities and personnel. We know what those loads are and how many people are needed to run what is basically in a highly automized factory. And we have massive reductions in both of those. So, like the cost model is well understood. It\u2019s really about rate and yield, which will come in time, as Elon said, over the course of this year and next.\nElon Musk: Yes.\nMartin Viecha: Thank you. And the next question is, how does Tesla plan to secure raw materials required to scale to extreme size?\nElon Musk: Yes. So, this is something we think about quite a lot. It depends what extreme size means. But certainly looking at, like, say, the $5 million, $10 million, $20 million -- 5 million, 10 million, 20 million vehicle levels, you really have to analyze the sort of macroeconomic, just like what is the tonnage of lithium that you need, of nickel, of iron phosphate, of graphite separators, electrolytes. It looks like really you think of like just macro tonnage. And when we need to think about this for the world as a whole, because just -- we want to -- what are limiting factors for accelerating the advent of a sustainable energy future. And whatever the most limiting factors are, Tesla will take action on those limiting factors. So, right now, we think mining and refining lithium is -- appears to be a limiting factor, and it certainly is responsible for quite a bit of cost growth in the sales. It\u2019s I think the single biggest cost growth item right now certainly on a percentage basis. Although just for those who don\u2019t totally know this, the actual content of lithium in lithium ion cell is maybe around 2% or 3% of the cell, so.\nAndrew Baglino: 5 kgs a car.\nElon Musk: Yes, exactly. 5 kg. It\u2019s not -- it\u2019s called lithium ion cell, but by far, like the most expensive and heaviest item in the cell is the cathode. So, that\u2019s the nickel or the iron phosphate. So we\u2019re looking carefully at all of the raw materials and trying to figure out how we can accelerate the total amount of raw materials needed to transition the world to sustainability. And I think we\u2019ve got -- we don\u2019t have enough time on this call to really go through all those details, but we are thinking about these things. And we think we\u2019ll have some exciting announcements in the months to come.\nAndrew Baglino: Yes. One thing I want to call out is like we\u2019re also committed to recycling at all of our cell factories. We\u2019re recycling 50 tons a week right now in Reno and ramping to 150 with all of that reclaimed material going directly back into our cathode supply chain. So, we\u2019re looking at the beginning and end of life needs here.\nElon Musk: And that\u2019s true like since Reno, we built a Gigafactory and we started doing that with batteries. But as we build newer factories or vehicles, for example, Giga Texas here, where we are today, we said was all of its non-yielded or scrap aluminum from the stamping shop directly into the casting shop. We regrind any plastic figures out. And so, we\u2019re really concerned about raw materials, not just like mining them and consuming them, but when we get them in the door, using all 100% of them.\nAndrew Baglino: Yes. No, that\u2019s a great point. So, we\u2019re storing -- we\u2019re installing sort of furnaces [ph] for probably for aluminum like sort for the Model Y that we\u2019ve built here in Giga Texas has both a front and a rear body casting. So, we\u2019re casting almost two-thirds of the body. It\u2019s high pressure die cast aluminum. And so, we can take both, scrap from the casting machine and the gating that comes out and put that -- just really pass that back into the melting -- aluminum melting pot. And then, as Elon was saying, also take any stampings and any other aluminum scrap and also through that in the melting pot, matter of fact, we\u2019ve also figured out that we can use wheels from practically any car. Yes, yes. So, we\u2019re going to be recycling the casting aluminum wheels from legacy gasoline cars as well and throwing that in the melting pot for our aluminum cast body of Model Y. And also we\u2019ll be moving to the sort of cast part rear body in all vehicles over time? Well, actually, maybe not S/X, but 3/Y.\nMartin Viecha: Thank you. At what rate do you expect Berlin and Austin to ramp relative to Shanghai? Are you able to leverage learnings from Shanghai, or are the processes substantially different in the new factories?\nElon Musk: Ramp production faster than Shanghai because we have learned a lot. And we\u2019ve now gone through the -- we have basically veteran teams that obviously in the 3/Y ramp -- Y ramp especially in multiple locations. And we\u2019re obviously sharing what we\u2019ve learned. And so, we don\u2019t want to get complacent or entitled, but this should be a faster ramp because we have learned more, and we have done a lot to simplify the production prices of Model Y that should lead us to a faster ramp within Texas and Berlin. Yes.\nAndrew Baglino: But we also had a structural casting, about 30% less robots, we expect to almost double the capacity for body, for example, reducing the number of robots, but doubling our capacity in a lot of areas.\nElon Musk: Yes. Right. The body line for the structural pack is -- and if you got a structural pack and front and rear castings, the body shop size drops by over 60% relative to the standard way of making a car.\nAndrew Baglino: [Technical Difficulty] general assembly or everything else because, we have the structural battery, the floor is the battery. We put the seats on the battery and then we put that in the cars. So there\u2019s actually 10% and 15% of our stations in GA because of the general assembly [Technical Difficulty]. So, really, like I think about this and the way we think about cars, if you\u2019re waiting for the best Tesla, you\u2019re going to be waiting forever. If you\u2019re waiting for investment, you\u2019re also going to be waiting forever because every new factory is better than the last one because we take all that learning and triple it\u2026\nElon Musk: Yes.\nMartin Viecha: Yes Next question is at Cyber Rodeo, Elon mentioned that a futuristic driverless robotaxi vehicle is on the roadmap. When can we expect more details on the product offering to be unveiled? Is this something that people can own, or will this be only offered by Tesla as a service?\nElon Musk: So, I think we want to hold up on -- we don\u2019t want to jump the gun on an exciting product announcement too much. So, I think, we\u2019ll aim to -- we do a product event for robotaxi next year and get into more detail, but we are aiming for volume production in 2024.\nMartin Viecha: All right. And maybe the last question from investors is, what is the current run rate of 4680 cell production at Fremont and at Giga Texas? What do you expect run rates of 4680 to be in Fremont and the Giga Texas or Berlin at the end of the year?\nElon Musk: Well, Berlin is using the 2170 nonstructural pack. So, they\u2019re not constrained by 4680. They will transition to 4680 hopefully later this year, but current billing production does not to require that. We also have, just as a risk mitigation, 2170 nonstructural pack capability in -- here at Giga Texas as well. But -- if things go according to plan, we will be in volume production with 4680 sometime perhaps towards the end of the third quarter and certainly in the fourth quarter. Is that accurate?\nAndrew Baglino: Yes. And the other thing I would add is like with the China COVID shutdown and the semiconductor bottlenecks we had through Q4 and hence a little bit in Q1, we have sizable cell inventory at the moment, and excess cells to support the 2022 volume targets you described. So, that gives us the ability to be pretty deliberate in the 4680 ramp where we can maximize learning step by step, take engineering downtime to upgrade key pieces of equipment and modify the structural pack design to improve reliability, all while achieving what you just said, so.\nElon Musk: Yes. 4680 output is not a risk to achieving 1.5 million vehicles produced this year, but it would become a risk next year if we do not solve volume production by early 2023, but we\u2019re highly confident of doing so.\nMartin Viecha: Thank you very much. Let\u2019s go to analyst questions now. The first question comes from Dan Levy from CSFB. Please go ahead and unmute yourself.\nDan Levy: Hi. Good evening. Thank you for taking the questions. First, maybe you can just talk through or address what some of the drivers of cost improvement were in the quarter. Was it just further improvements within Shanghai or in Fremont? Anything around sort of ongoing kaizen that you\u2019ve talked about in the past? Maybe you could just talk through what you benefited from in the first quarter.\nZachary Kirkhorn: Sure. I mean, at a high level, cars produced in Shanghai do carry a lower cost structure than cars produced in Fremont. And so, as our mix of cars shift towards Shanghai, the average cost is positively impacted by that. We\u2019re also seeing some progress in manufacturing efficiencies in Fremont, particularly on the S and X side as volume increases improves there. Expedites has been a huge story for the company. Q4, we had massive amounts of expedites. Q1 was still quite large, but we did make progress on bringing that down some.\nElon Musk: Special mention goes to the Fremont manufacturing team and our associates there because we\u2019re achieving record output at Fremont.\nZachary Kirkhorn: Yes. The Fremont team is doing a tremendous job. Really absolutely from the back [ph] quarters.\nElon Musk: Yes.\nAndrew Baglino: It\u2019s hard to underweight. Like you should -- the expedite situation with the crazy logistics that occurred with COVID.\nZachary Kirkhorn: Yes. And to Elon\u2019s point, the Fremont team and also the Shanghai team has been extremely dynamic with the unpredictable nature of our part arrivals, and our supply chain team, in particular, production planning portion of supply chain. We often get very little notice when there\u2019s part shortage is coming, and it\u2019s kind of a scramble couple of days before that part is supposed to arrive to figure out how to get it here. And so, the amount of Herculean effort that goes in to produce a quarter like Q1 and even the quarters before that is absolutely immense.\nElon Musk: There\u2019s a saying in the military, it\u2019s like amateurs talk about tactics, professionals talk about logistics when it comes to war.\nZachary Kirkhorn: Yes. So, there were some inherent cost improvements, as I mentioned, but there\u2019s also offsets that we\u2019ve talked about previously on raw materials, commodities. Outbound logistics continues to remain a challenge despite a ton of efforts to increase capacity there and bring those costs down.\nDan Levy: Second question, one of the initial goals of Model 3 way back when was to have an EV that was affordable for a wide portion of the market. And we know prices are much higher now just given the supply constraints. Prices are higher for all other automakers. We know that there\u2019s inflation that you\u2019re battling through, and some of that needs to be passed through the price of the vehicles. And you\u2019re going to be supply-constrained for the foreseeable future. So, it\u2019s one of the points. But given the goal long term of making EVs more widely available to the masses over time, how do you look at the progression of prices over time?\nElon Musk: We absolutely want to make EVs as affordable as possible. It\u2019s been very difficult with the -- I mean, I think, inflation is at like a 40 or 50-year high. And I think the official numbers actually understate the true magnitude of inflation, so. And that inflation appears to be likely to continue for at least the remainder of this year is what -- when we\u2019re talking to suppliers, suppliers are under severe cost pressure. So, yes, and in some cases, we\u2019re seeing suppliers request 20% to 30% cost increases for parts from last year to the end of this year. So, it\u2019s -- there\u2019s a lot of cost pressure there. That\u2019s why we raised our prices because we -- when things are on -- with respect to inflation, you know it\u2019s high, then -- and we\u2019ve got orders that go out a year or more in some cases, then we have to anticipate those cost increases. But I think, especially with the robotaxi and autonomy, I think we will end up providing consumers with, by far, the lowest cost per mile of transport that they\u2019ve ever experienced. Yes. I mean with robotaxi, like maybe 5 to 10 times cost per mile. It\u2019s really quite substantial.\nAndrew Baglino: And therefore, accessible to everybody.\nElon Musk: Yes. I mean, looking at some of our projections, it would appear that a robotaxi ride will cost less than a bus ticket, a subsidized bus ticket or subsidized subway ticket.\nMartin Viecha: Thank you very much. Let\u2019s go to the next question from Rod Lache from Wolfe Research.\nRod Lache: Hi, everybody. I\u2019m trying to just parse out your comments about the inflation and constrained supply and battery feedstocks and the initiatives that you are working on internally to secure these materials. It sounds like you\u2019re optimistic about Tesla\u2019s ability to solve this for Tesla. Do you -- but do you see this as a constraint on EV adoption more broadly?\nElon Musk: Yes, absolutely. But what\u2019s sort of keeping our costs down, at least in the short term, is that we have long-term contracts with suppliers, but those long-term contracts will obviously run out and then the year we\u2019ll start to see potentially significant cost increases. But the macro is sort of looking at the world as a whole and saying, okay, what does it take for earth to transition to sustainable energy faster? It\u2019s fundamentally -- the fundamental limiting factor is the output of cell -- basically, cell output -- at what rate can lithium ion cells increase the gigawatt hours per year? That is the fundamental limiting factor. So, in order -- and that will move as fast as the slowest, least lucky element of the whole supply chain. Currently, we see that as being a challenge with lithium. And it\u2019s not that -- to be clear, it\u2019s not that there\u2019s a shortage of lithium ore in the world. Lithium is present almost everywhere. It\u2019s a very common element. However, you still need to take up the ore -- take up basically sludge or whatever the clay with the lithium and then you need to go through a whole series of refinement steps. And that\u2019s a lot of industrial equipment that\u2019s needed to refine lithium ore to lithium that can be used as lithium hydroxide or lithium carbonate in the battery cell. So, we think we\u2019re going to need to help the industry on this front, but the -- I mean, the industry is very fast. And I certainly encourage entrepreneurs out there who are looking for opportunities to get into the lithium business. The lithium margins right now are practically software margins. I mean, if the -- I think it\u2019s something -- I think there\u2019s a -- I mean, -- correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but I think we\u2019re seeing cases where the spot lithium price is 10 times higher than the cost of extraction. So, like we\u2019re talking 19% margins here. Can some -- can more people please get into the lithium business? It\u2019s -- do you like minting money? Well, the lithium business is for you.\nRod Lache: Interesting. So, I guess, we\u2019ll stay tuned to see what happens from that. My second question is it\u2019s impressive to see just a modest increase in cost per vehicle -- cost of goods sold per vehicle, given what we\u2019ve seen in terms of commodities actually. And from here, you have a lot of savings opportunities with 4680 cells and the cell manufacturing changes, the anode chemistry, structural packs, giga castings. Are you suggesting that even those may not be sufficient to offset the inflation that you\u2019re seeing and that you\u2019re going to need additional pricing as well in addition to those specific initiatives that you\u2019ve called out?\nElon Musk: We hope we don\u2019t need to increase the pricing further. The current pricing is anticipating what we think is the probable growth in costs. And if those growth -- if that growth in cost does not materialize, we actually may slightly reduce prices. So, should we currently anticipate making significant price increases. But obviously, we don\u2019t control the macroeconomic environment. If governments keep printing vast amounts of money and if there\u2019s -- if there are not significant increases in lithium extraction and refinement and other raw materials, such that everyone is competing for a limited amount of raw materials, then obviously, that will drive prices to high levels. So, if you have a crystal ball that can tell us what the future is going to be like, we\u2019ll adjust accordingly. But, the current prices are what we -- the current prices are for a vehicle delivered in the future, like 6 to 12 months from now. So, this is our best guess.\nAndrew Baglino: But I think if you zoom out, right, like as you said, our mission is to accelerate the transition to sustainable energy. So, we are working with our existing suppliers and others to figure out how to grow all of these raw materials as quickly as possible to not slow down the transition.\nElon Musk: Yes.\nAndrew Baglino: And whether that means we have to get directly involved in some cases or not comes down to the counterparty and their willingness to expand at the rate we think they should be able to expand. And that\u2019s similar to what we\u2019ve done with everything else, like we built a Gigafactory in Reno because it needed to be done. And so, like we will do what needs to be done to not slow down the transition. And affordability is a goal because it\u2019s unaffordable. It\u2019s going to retard the growth of what is inherently a good thing that we can\u2019t have that as an outcome.\nMartin Viecha: Thank you. The next question comes from Pierre Ferragu from New Street Research.\nPierre Ferragu: Thanks. Can you hear me well?\nMartin Viecha: Yes.\nPierre Ferragu: Great. I\u2019d like to ask you some questions about free cash flow. Do you -- so first, maybe in the long run, if you look at your performance and your growth model and your growth ambitions, I did the math very quick. And I see you guys sitting on $400 billion or maybe $500 billion of cash at the end of the decade. And I was wondering if it\u2019s something you have given some thoughts about.\nElon Musk: If inflation keeps going crazy, $500 billion might be like $20 billion today. I don\u2019t know. So, we\u2019ll see what $500 billion buys you in a decade, but it might be a lot less. So, I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll -- that seems like a lot of cash. I don\u2019t know. We\u2019ll try to do something useful with it. I mean, Zach, I don\u2019t know -- I realize that\u2019s problem, that\u2019s for sure.\nZachary Kirkhorn: The way we\u2019ve been -- I think we have to take this one step at a time. And so, we have investments that are happening right now to get Austin and Berlin up and running. And then, as Elon mentioned, installing capacity for robotaxi production. And there are some decisions that, as Elon alluded to, just to share in the future about what the economic model looks like -- what the economic model looks like for robotaxi. And so, the way Elon and I have discussed this is [Technical Difficulty]\nElon Musk: Maybe just everyone [Technical Difficulty]\nZachary Kirkhorn: Yes. So, our focus is to get to the point where robotaxis are on the road, Optimus is in use, get the economic model for that dialed in, and then evaluate the size of cash flows at that point and make decisions then as to what\u2019s next.\nMartin Viecha: Pierre, do you have a follow-up question?\nPierre Ferragu: [Technical Difficulty]\nMartin Viecha: All right. Let\u2019s go to the next one. The next question comes from Trip Chowdhry from Global Equity Research.\nTrip Chowdhry: Thank you. Two questions I have. First is regarding the Cybertruck. And I was wondering like in terms of number of parts, how would Cybertruck compare with the traditional pickup truck in terms of number of parts? The second question I have is on Gigafactory Nevada, Sparks. Will we have any production of vehicles in that factory, or all the future production will happen in Giga Austin? Thank you.\nElon Musk: I\u2019m not sure if we\u2019ve actually done a comparison of Cybertruck parts versus regular truck parts. I mean, Lars?\nLars Moravy: Yes. I mean, if you want to go down the like -- it depends on what kind of part. We still have cells in [Technical Difficulty]\nElon Musk: Mention count.\nLars Moravy: If we don\u2019t count that, like the simplicity of our structure is significant versus a traditional pickup truck or any other vehicle, like as we\u2019ve talked about their gigacastings, we save hundreds of parts there.\nElon Musk: I mean, the entire rear -- kind of half of the car is one cast.\nLars Moravy: So, with the Cybertruck and the doors, for example, we have an exoskeleton design where the door is ready to take and it takes all the long-term impact. So, we really have -- like we don\u2019t have the door reinforcements. We don\u2019t have the [Technical Difficulty]. So, to your point, I haven\u2019t counted them because I don\u2019t often look back at old technologies to decide how well I\u2019m doing. I check that once in a while. But in general, architecture is always moving to reduce complexity, reduce parts or reduce parts count. I would say, ignoring the battery cells, we are probably 20% to 30% less.\nElon Musk: All right.\nMartin Viecha: Okay.\nElon Musk: Do we expect to expand? Yes, we do expect to expand Giga Nevada. There\u2019s a lot of room for expansion there, and we do expect to increase output from Nevada, but by far, the biggest increase in output will be from Giga Texas.\nMartin Viecha: Thank you very much. The next question comes from Alex Potter from Piper Sandler. Alex, can you hear us?\nAlex Potter: Yes. Hi Martin, can you hear me?\nMartin Viecha: Yes.\nAlex Potter: Okay, great. So first question I had was the extent to which other plants outside of China are insulated from any further upstream supply bottlenecks that we may have in China. Obviously, if this COVID lockdown things gets out of hand, clearly, that\u2019s going to continue impacting Shanghai. But is there a point at which it could actually also impact other facilities?\nElon Musk: Yes. If it would continue, but there are some parts that are sourced in China that apply worldwide. And that would be -- that would impact production elsewhere. But all indications are that we are -- our Giga Shanghai is back in production at fairly high levels already and so are our suppliers. So, we don\u2019t think this is going to be a big deal.\nAlex Potter: Okay. Thanks. Second question, obviously, the higher profitability that you guys have been able to experience over the last couple of quarters, a lot of that is reflecting sort of \"real\" improvement. Another part of it is because we\u2019re no longer paying you, Elon, as much as we were. And so I\u2019m wondering the extent to which you and the Board are in the process of contemplating another one of these long-term compensation packages, which in the past have seemed to work quite well. Thanks.\nElon Musk: There are no discussions currently underway for incremental compensation for me.\nMartin Viecha: Thank you. The next question comes from Colin Langan from Wells Fargo.\nColin Langan: Great. Do you guys hear me?\nMartin Viecha: Yes.\nColin Langan: Perfect. Just to follow-up, sorry to keep going on the raw material issue on the battery side, but obviously, it seems pretty important. How quickly can raw material supply be built? Because my understanding is it takes many years to build that out. So, are we just sort of facing -- when do you think we see a lithium shortage or a nickel shortage? And is there even enough time to build that sort of mining capacity in place? And then related, how quickly can you switch to like LFP for the nickel issue?\nAndrew Baglino: Yes. I mean, I\u2019ll take the LFP question. Like, it says so in our letter, like half of our products were LFP last quarter, which shows how quickly we were able to respond to -- well, honestly, it wasn\u2019t because of a raw material shortage, but just because it seemed like the right thing to do, we could change our cathode chemistry. And there\u2019s more to be done on the cathode side. And we are actively pursuing it to give us substitution flexibility in response to market conditions between the other cathodes that are out there that can be competitive in our vehicles, which there are many options. So, we -- I guess, what I would say is, specifically on the cathode side, like flexibility is the way we\u2019re going to achieve this. And not all of the materials that go into cathodes are actually, first of all, hard to secure like through mining or refining; and second of all, in many cases, are like very plentiful already, like huge scale. And if all of the batteries in the world use those cathodes, it\u2019s less than a 1% increase in total annual output. So, that\u2019s the cathode side. I think, Elon already spent a lot of time talking about lithium. It really depends on the resource. Some resources like just getting rocks out of the ground, expanding the amount of rock that you\u2019re getting out of the ground is maybe a little bit of paperwork and some additional sort of blasting and trucking operations. The refining is maybe where there\u2019s -- it\u2019s a little bit more chunky to bring it on line, but also the refining doesn\u2019t -- it\u2019s not like an oil refinery. It\u2019s a much smaller operation to refine lithium out of spodumene or for liquid, like a brine or a salt pond evaporation. So you\u2019re talking about a time scale of 1 to 2 years. And it\u2019s not like we haven\u2019t been talking to all of the lithium suppliers out there for many years. They have a lot of projects already in the pipeline to come on line this year and next. Some of what\u2019s going on in the lithium market this year doesn\u2019t actually have truth to bear to the like fundamentals of supply and demand, which is also a little frustrating. But yes, if we look past this year or next year, into 2030 when we need to 15 to 20 terawatt hours of this stuff to get on the growth trajectory -- stay on the growth trajectory we\u2019re on, we need everybody to do more in the lithium space than they currently are. I don\u2019t know if that answers the question.\nColin Langan: Yes.\nMartin Viecha: Fantastic. Thank you very much. So, let\u2019s go to the last question from Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs.\nMark Delaney: Yes. Good afternoon. And thank you very much for taking the questions. I was hoping you could comment on your latest thoughts about potentially opening up the charging network in the U.S. to non-Tesla orders. I mean, certainly really important to have a good experience for Tesla owners in terms of wait times and charge installs. But Tesla is able to have enough capacity, it could be a really good way to bring other vehicle owners into the Tesla network, perhaps help Tesla to sustain its network benefits and maybe make more people likely to buy a Tesla vehicles in the future.\nAndrew Baglino: Yes. As Elon has said and as we\u2019ve publicly committed, yes, we do plan to provide third-party vehicle access in all over the world, not just in Europe, where our original pilot was. And we are working on solutions in North America, which is a little bit more problematic with our connector being different than others, but we are moving in that direction. I don\u2019t know if you want to add.\nElon Musk: Yes, I think that\u2019s -- there\u2019s nothing more to be said on that, but we\u2019re -- yes, we want to do the right thing with respect to the whole system.\nZachary Kirkhorn: And we\u2019re going faster on adding chargers. With the growth of the cars that we\u2019re producing and then anticipating what you were discussing, overall charger capacity is really important. And so, the pace of our investment in supercharging has accelerated.\nElon Musk: Absolutely.\nMark Delaney: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And for my second question, could you share any more details on Tesla Insurance, in particular, as you roll it out in more states. Are there any metrics you can share on what take rates have been like? And how do profitability margins on the insurance offering compared to the corporate average? Thank you.\nZachary Kirkhorn: So, we just launched Tesla Insurance for real-time insurance in Virginia, Colorado and Oregon earlier this week. Maybe one step that I\u2019ll share. So, Texas is our longest-standing real-time insurance market. But based upon the information that we have, Tesla is the second largest insurer of Teslas in the State of Texas. And possibly by the end of this quarter, maybe early next quarter, we\u2019ll be the largest insurer of Teslas. And so, the customer reception to this has been quite positive. And I was reading social media on Monday after we launched in the three new states, a lot of folks who are reporting their stories of saving quite substantial amounts of money relative to their previous insurance. And so, we\u2019re quite encouraged by that. And we\u2019re working as quickly as we can to get to 80% of customers having access to a Tesla Insurance product by the end of this year in the United States, at which point we\u2019ll pivot our attention to expansion outside of the U.S. The other thing I\u2019ll say on insurance is with these three new states, the model is different because we are now the underwriter, and we are also now holding the risk. And so, with those states, we are a fully vertically integrated provider of insurance from systems and financials. With respect to the financials of the program, it\u2019s still very early. And so, as the program gets more scale, happy to share more information on that.\nElon Musk: And ones I noticed that we are seeing that the -- having real-time feedback for driving habits is actually resulting in Tesla owners driving the cars in a safer way because they can see the -- they get real-time feedback on, okay, this is affecting my insurance rate or it isn\u2019t. And so, when people see it -- they can see a real-time score, they realize, if I make the following changes in my driving habits, then I pay less in insurance, then they have a very -- like a real-time feedback loop for driving for safer driving and an incentive to do so. So, it is -- actually, what we\u2019re seeing is it is causing people to drive their cars in a safer manner, which is also net good.\nZachary Kirkhorn: It\u2019s safer on average, what we see in the data, to Elon\u2019s point, and premiums are lower. We see that in the take rate data, we have extremely high retention for customers who experience the product. And I think I\u2019ve talked about this in the past, but this has become a real passion program for us for these benefits. It\u2019s bigger than just the economics. We\u2019re trying to do a good thing here for our customers, save people money and make the roads a little bit safer.\nElon Musk: Yes. I think it improves just overall macroeconomic efficiency. It\u2019s also a feedback loop for Tesla because we see if there is crash, both large or small, like we sort of see exactly what that caused. And then we think about how can we change the design of the car or the software in order to minimize the probability of that accident. Most accidents are minor, but how do you have those accidents occur less frequently? And how do we make the repair associated with that accident super fast? Like, aspirationally, it would be like a same-day repair of a collision, which is night and day difference compared to sometimes having to wait for a month while insurance claims are settled and figured out -- because Tesla is also doing collision repair.\nZachary Kirkhorn: Yes, the feedback loop is instant.\nElon Musk: Yes.\nZachary Kirkhorn: Right. So, I mean, we do claims management in-house. And so, we receive the notification that there\u2019s an accident, we work to prepare the estimate. And we can, with the support of our customers, use our collision centers to do the repair. And so, it\u2019s full end-to-end visibility. And all of that, to Elon\u2019s, we can then identify areas of cost inefficiency, feed those back to our engineering teams or elsewhere, software teams, actually improve the product. This lowers the cost of insurance, improves reliability of the product. So, it\u2019s a full circle.\nElon Musk: Yes. And basically, the customer experience is just vastly better because if there\u2019s an accident, there\u2019s no argument. We\u2019ll repair it immediately. And this is as compared to arguing with an insurance company and then a claims adjuster and then a collision repair center. And this can be a nightmare basically. So we\u2019re trying to turn a nightmare into a dream with Tesla Insurance.\nMartin Viecha: Fantastic. Thank you very much. Unfortunately, that\u2019s all the time we have for this quarter. So, thank you very much for all your great questions, and we\u2019ll speak to you again in three months.\nElon Musk: Thank you."}], "analyst_estimate": [{"symbol": "TSLA", "date": "2025-12-31",
