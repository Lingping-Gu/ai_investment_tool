Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Q4 was our first-ever $5 billion quarter, a new record for the company. Adobe achieved revenue of $5.05 billion, representing 13% year-over-year growth. GAAP earnings per share for the quarter was $3.23 and non-GAAP earnings per share was $4.27, representing 28% and 19% year-over-year growth, respectively. Q4 was the culmination of another record year for Adobe, achieving $19.41 billion in revenue, which represents 13% annual growth. GAAP earnings per share in fiscal 2023 was $11.82 and non-GAAP earnings per share was $16.07, both representing 17% year-over-year growth. We exited the year with $17.22 billion in RPO. Our strong performance reflects the mission-critical role our products play in a digital-first world, incredible product innovation and exceptional execution. Adobe Creative Cloud, Document Cloud, and Experience Cloud have become the foundation of digital experiences, starting with the moment of inspiration to the creation and development of content and media to the personalized delivery and activation across every channel. Adobe's mission of changing the world through personalized digital experiences and our delivery of foundational technology platforms, set us up for the next decade of growth. We take pride in being one of the most inventive, diversified, and profitable software companies in the world. We believe that every massive technology shift offers generational opportunities to deliver new products and solutions to an ever-expanding set of customers. AI and generative AI is one such opportunity and we've articulated, how we intend to invest and differentiate across, data, models, and interfaces. We have delivered against this strategy and I'm pleased that a number of our groundbreaking innovations, including our Firefly models and integrations across Creative Cloud, Liquid Mode and integrations across Document Cloud and AI services in our real-time Customer Data Platform and integrations in Experience Cloud, are now seeing tremendous usage by customers. We remain excited about the strategic opportunity with Figma, to jointly advance product design, accelerate collaborative creativity on the web, and redefine the future of creativity and productivity. We continue to engage with the European Commission, the Competition and Markets Authority in the UK, and the US Department of Justice, as they conduct their regulatory reviews. The EC has provided a preliminary statement of objections and the CMA has issued provisional findings of competition concerns. We strongly disagree with these findings and are responding to the respective regulators. As per the current timelines, the EC's decision deadline is February 5th and the CMA\u2019s is February 25th, while the DOJ does not have a formal timeline to decide whether to bring a complaint, we expect a decision soon. I'll now turn it over to David to discuss the momentum in our Digital Media business.\nDavid Wadhwani: Thanks, Shantanu. Hello, everyone. In Q4, we achieved net new Digital Media ARR of $569 million and revenue of $3.72 billion, which grew 14% year-over-year, fueled by innovation in both our Creative and Document businesses. Starting with Creative Cloud, global demand for content is accelerating and continues to be a tailwind for the business. Creative Cloud remains the creativity platform of choice for creators across imaging photography, design, video, web, animation, and 3D. Our rapid pace of product and AI model innovation is empowering a wide and growing base of individuals, students, creative professionals, small-business owners, and enterprises to create and monetize amazing content more quickly and easily than ever before. We were thrilled to come together in person with thousands of creators at Adobe MAX in Los Angeles. And at our MAX event in Tokyo with millions more from our community engaging with us online. We reached a record 300 million social interactions in the month following MAX. Q4 was a record quarter for Creative Cloud, achieving $3 billion in revenue, which grew 14% year-over-year. Net new Creative Cloud ARR was $398 million. Business highlights include strong digital traffic, resulting from product innovation, social engagement, and our continued product-led growth efforts which drove record new commercial subscriptions in the quarter. The general availability of our generative AI Firefly models and their integrations across Creative Cloud drove tremendous customer excitement with over 4.5 billion generations since launch in March. The release of three new Firefly models, Firefly Image two model, Firefly Vector model, and Firefly Design model, offering highly differentiated levels of control with Effects, Photo Settings, and Generative Match. We also introduced Generative Credits as part of our Creative Cloud subscription plans. The general availability of Photoshop Generative Fill and Generative Expand which are seeing record adoption, they're already among the most used features in the product. Advances in Adobe Illustrator with the introduction of Text to Vector beta enabling users to generate icons, scenes, subjects, patterns, gradients. Adobe Premiere Pro advances include a significant performance improvement in the timeline for faster and smoother editing, new color preferences, and improved tone mapping. Premiere Pro is now natively integrated with Frame.io offering faster content sharing and collaboration. The combination of Adobe Express and Firefly is enabling everyone from Creative Pros to beginners to quickly move from ideation to task-based workflows in Express dramatically expanding our reach and widening our top-of-funnel. The family of generative capabilities across Express including Text to Image, Text Effects, Text to Template, and Generative Fill are driving adoption of Express and making it even faster and more fun for users of all skill levels. Express now comes pre-installed on all new Chromebooks, making it accessible to students, educators, and anyone using Chrome OS. Continued strength in Adobe Stock which had its best year ever driven by accelerating demand for high-quality image, vector, video, and 3D content. Creative Cloud, Express, and Firefly integrations with Adobe GenStudio enabling ideation, creation, and stakeholder collaboration as part of their overall content supply chain. Strong mid-market and enterprise adoption driven by up-sell to Creative Cloud offerings with Firefly. Key customer wins include Cyber Agent, Deloitte, Discovery Communications, Nexstar Media, Pepsi, Publicis, and the United Nations. We are thrilled with the momentum we're seeing in the Creative business following a year of unprecedented innovation. Customer excitement around Firefly integrations across our applications has been great to see with community engagement, social interactions, and creative marketing campaigns, driving organic brand search volume, traffic, and record demand. While we started rolling out new Creative Cloud pricing in select geographies in November, the primary driver of growth continues to be new paid subscriptions across our routes-to-market. We are excited to build on this momentum as we enter FY '24. Now turning to Document Cloud, digital documents are essential enablers of our personal and professional lives. Document Cloud is a leader in digital documents powering all common document actions including editing, sharing, reviewing, scanning, and signing. Document Cloud innovations are advancing accessibility, comprehension, productivity, automation, and security in document workflows across web, desktop, and mobile. In Q4, we achieved Document Cloud revenue of $721 million, growing 17% year-over-year. We added a record $171 million of net new Document Cloud ARR with ending ARR growing 23% year-over-year in constant currency. Business highlights include Acrobat Web growth, which continues to be an incredible source of customer acquisition, with monthly active users up over 70% year-over-year. The surge in usage of link sharing for stakeholder collaboration around PDF files, which increased 400% year-over-year, creating a viral growth loop, that is bringing tens of millions of users into the Acrobat ecosystem. This is a great example of how we are scaling our PLG motions. Strong demand for Acrobat on mobile with MAU surpassing 100 million users in Q4. Liquid Mode has now served over one billion files to customers demonstrating how indispensable this technology has become on mobile devices. Adobe Acrobat to Express workflows making it even easier to import, edit, and enhance documents to create visually stunning PDFs. Key enterprise customer wins include Alshaya, Bank of America, Department of Veterans Affairs, Mastercard, State Farm Auto Insurance, and Volkswagen. Much like the Creative business, we expect generative AI to deliver additional value and attract new customers to Document Cloud. Acrobat's generative AI capabilities, which will enable new creation, comprehension and collaboration functionality have already been rolled out in a private beta. We expect to release this in a public beta in the coming months.

What a year 2023 was, fueled by a deep understanding of our customers, product innovation, and outstanding execution, we delivered strong financial results and world-class margins, positioning the company for years of continued growth. In FY '23, Adobe achieved record revenue of $19.41 billion, which represents 10% year-over-year growth or 13% growth in constant currency. GAAP EPS for the year was $11.82 and non-GAAP EPS was $16.7; each growing 17% year-over-year. FY '23 business and financial highlights included Digital Media revenue of $14.22 billion, net new Digital Media ARR of $1.91 billion, Digital Experience revenue of $4.89 billion, cash flows from operations of $7.3 billion, RPO was $17.22 billion exiting the year and repurchasing approximately 11.5 million shares of our stock during the year at a cost of $4.63 billion. In the fourth quarter of FY '23, Adobe achieved revenue of $5.05 billion, which represents 12% year-over-year growth or 13% in constant currency. GAAP-diluted earnings per share in Q4 was $3.23 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was a record $4.27, growing 28% and 19% year-over-year, respectively. Q4 business and financial highlights included Digital Media revenue of $3.72 billion, net new Digital Media ARR of $569 million, Digital Experience revenue of $1.27 billion, cash flows from operations of $1.6 billion. Adding approximately $1.5 billion RPO in the quarter, our highest sequential quarterly increase ever and repurchasing approximately 1.8 million shares of our stock. In our Digital Media segment, we achieved Q4 revenue of $3.72 billion, which represents 13% year-over-year growth, or 14% in constant currency. Our net-new ARR in Q4 was $569 million, which was a quarterly record in constant currency and we exited the quarter with $15.17 billion of Digital Media ARR. We achieved Creative revenue of $3 billion, which represents 12% year-over-year growth or 14% in constant currency and we added $398 million of net-new Creative ARR in the quarter. Driving this performance was strong customer acquisition throughout the quarter as well as strength during the peak holiday shopping weeks. Fourth quarter Creative growth drivers included individual subscriber growth fueled by targeted campaigns and strong web traffic. A strong quarter for Creative Cloud All Apps subscriptions across customer segments and geographies, with particular strength in emerging markets. Sales of CC single apps, including a strong quarter for Imaging and photography offerings. Continued growth of our Frame.io offering and Adobe Stock which capped off its best year ever in terms of net-new ARR. Customer demand in education driven by back-to-school purchasing as well as migrations to full-priced offerings by graduating students entering the workforce. And typical Q4 strength in the Enterprise, including significant upsell of our new Firefly and Express offerings. Adobe achieved Document Cloud revenue of $721 million, which represents 16% year-over-year growth or 17% in constant currency. We added a record $171 million of net new Document Cloud ARR in the quarter. Fourth quarter Document Cloud growth drivers included, Acrobat's subscription demand across all customer segments routes-to-market, and geographies. Continued strength of our free-to-paid funnels including Reader on the desktop and Acrobat web. Strong performance of our collaboration services including PDF link sharing and Sign, which are virally bringing new users to the Acrobat ecosystem. An outstanding quarter for Acrobat Mobile as a result of increased proliferation, usage, and conversion and year-end seasonal strength in SMB and enterprise. Turning to our Digital Experience segment, in Q4, we achieved revenue of $1.27 billion, growing 10% year-over-year, or 11% in constant currency. We achieved subscription revenue of $1.12 billion, which represents 12% year-over-year growth. Fourth quarter Digital Experience growth drivers included strong year-end bookings across solutions with particular strength in North America, continued success closing multi-solution transformational deals with large enterprises, momentum with AEP and native applications with the FY '23 exiting book of business growing greater than 60% year-over-year, strong net dollar retention for early adopters of AEP, demonstrating the value enterprises are realizing from our real-time data platform and integrated offerings, and strength across our data and insights, content and workfront solutions and growing customer interest and pipeline for our new GenStudio solution. We drove world-class operating margins in Q4 and throughout fiscal 2023 by making disciplined investments in R&D marketing and sales and we're pleased that we grew EPS faster than revenue. Adobe's effective tax rate in Q4 was 18% on a GAAP basis and 18.5% on a non-GAAP basis in line with our expectations. RPO exiting the quarter was $17.22 billion, growing 13% year-over-year. Our ending cash and short-term investment position exiting Q4 was $7.84 billion and cash flows from operations in the quarter were $1.6 billion, after making a previously discussed payment in the quarter of $826 million of US Federal taxes that we deferred from the second and third quarters of FY '23. In Q4, we entered into a $1 billion share repurchase agreement and we currently have $2.15 billion remaining of our $15 billion authorization granted in December 2020. As a reminder, we measure ARR on a constant-currency basis during the fiscal year and revalue ARR at year-end. FX rate changes between December of 2022 and this year have resulted in a $160 million increase to Digital Media ARR balance entering FY '24, which is now $15.33 billion and is reflected in our updated investor datasheet. Factoring in the momentum across our businesses and current expectations for the macroeconomic and foreign-exchange environments, for FY '24, we are targeting total Adobe revenue of $21.30 billion to $21.50 billion. Digital Media net new ARR of approximately $1.9 billion, Digital Media segment revenue of $15.75 billion to $15.85 billion, Digital Experience segment revenue of $5.275 billion to $5.375 billion, Digital Experience subscription revenue of $4.75 billion to $4.80 billion. Tax rate of approximately 18% on a GAAP basis and 18.5% on a non-GAAP basis. GAAP earnings per share of $13.45 to $13.85. And non-GAAP earnings per share of $17.60 to $18. As a reminder, and as is customary, these targets do not reflect our planned acquisition of Figma. We expect normal seasonality throughout the year with a seasonal step-down for new business into the first quarter, sequential growth from Q1 to Q2, typical Q3 summer seasonality, and a strong finish to the year in Q4. We expect our cash tax rate to improve sequentially in FY '24 by 2 percentage points as the amortization of previously capitalized R&D increases our deductions next year for tax purposes, benefiting our operating cash flows next year. For Q1 FY '24, we're targeting total Adobe revenue of $5.10 billion to $5.15 billion, Digital Media net new ARR of approximately $410 million, Digital Media segment revenue was $3.77 billion to 3.80 billion, Digital Experience segment revenue of $1.27 billion to $1.29 billion, Digital Experience subscription revenue of $1.14 billion to $1.16 billion. Tax rate of approximately 18% on a GAAP basis and 18.5% on a non-GAAP basis. GAAP earnings per share of $3.35 to $3.40. And non-GAAP earnings per share of $4.35 to $4.40. While the implied operating margin for Q1 is up sequentially, we expect a typical seasonal margin step-down starting in Q2 as a result of the annual merit increases and disciplined investments to drive growth. In summary, I couldn't be prouder of the company's performance in FY '23 and the momentum we're carrying into 2024 across Creative Cloud, Document Cloud, and Experience Cloud. Our strategy, scale, speed of execution, and profitability position us for years of sustained success. Shantanu, back to you.\nShantanu Narayen: Thanks, Dan. In addition to our financial accomplishments, we are proud to once again be recognized for our industry leadership. Content credentials and Adobe's approach to responsible AI were recognized by Fast Company as one of the year's breakthrough innovations. We were again named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, Glassdoor listed Adobe is one of the best places to work and Interbrand ranked us in the top 20 Best Global Brands as the rising brand for the eighth year in a row. Digital remains a massive tailwind as content demand and consumption continues to grow and businesses of all sizes are focused on transforming their customer experiences. Adobe is incredibly well-positioned to lead and capitalize on this opportunity. Thanks to our innovative roadmap expanding global customer base, strong brand, and the best employees in the world. Our fiscal '24 financial targets reflect our confidence in continuing to drive strong topline growth and world-class profitability. I am more certain than ever that Adobe's best days are ahead of us. Thank you, and we will now take questions. Operator.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We ask that you please limit yourself to one question. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nKash Rangan: Hi. Thank you very much. Congrats on the quarter and happy holidays. Shantanu and team, I'm wondering, going into 2024, it definitely feels like the economy is in stable footing and in general, the software metrics are all improving as the year unfolded. And very different from going from '22 to '23, yet your DM - new ARR guidance is about the same as how you started last year, but you got the benefit of generative AI, tailwinds from the economy, and got pricing and Firefly. Can you just help us understand if you isolate for those factors, what has gone into your -- into your guidance, but it seems like, if we exclude the optionality that you have, including the tailwinds in economy that guidance looks like it's very conservative. And maybe that's the right thing to do, but just wanted to understand your thought process. Thank you so much.\nShantanu Narayen: Yeah. Thanks, Kash. I mean, certainly, really thrilled with what a phenomenal year we had across all aspects of the business, whether it was the $5 billion quarter, $5 billion book of business now in DX exiting, and certainly Digital Media ARR performance. Let's -- if you reflect, I mean, you talked about the guidance that we gave at the beginning of '23 and '24, if you recall, we actually had guided to $16.50 first then we opted as you know, to $17.50, and ended with $19.13. And so to your point on the execution front, we have delivered some great innovative products. We've expanded the customer base with new products like Express and Firefly. We're certainly focused on surfaces and making sure all of our flagship products are available across all surfaces. And so we do have multiple growth drivers to your point. And we are focused on monetizing the opportunity. I mean, I would say, we take our guide very seriously, the other way of looking at it, Kash, is it\u2019s our highest annual guide ever in terms of what the guide we've issued, it's the highest Q1 guide ever and we want to go again, execute against this large opportunity and have another record year. So, we're feeling good, the momentum is certainly there in the business. But we take our guidance at this point of the year very seriously.\nKash Rangan: Thank you so much and happy holidays. All the best for 2024.\nShantanu Narayen: Thanks. Happy holidays.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nKeith Weiss: Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question. I think this is in a similar vein to what Kash was trying to get at. But maybe a little bit more focused on Q4 in particular. When we look at the Digital Media net new ARR adds in Q4, it looks like you had a very, very strong Document Cloud, record quarter like you were saying, really strong year-on-year growth in those net adds. Creative Cloud, where we actually saw price increase and we have all the excitement in Firefly, that was actually down on a year-on-year basis. And this is the first time since 2018 we've seen Creative Cloud net new ARR below $400 million. I think that's the surprise for investors -- a negative surprise for investors that we're trying to figure out, was there something dragging the Creative Cloud side of the equation this year, or a tough comp from last year, or something that explains why the price increases in all the positive momentum and innovation out of Adobe MAX isn't translating into net new ARR growth for Creative Cloud in particular.\nDavid Wadhwani: Yeah. Happy to take that. Keith, David here. So first of all, as you've mentioned in the DME business, we're really excited about the results for '24, over $1.9 billion in net new ARR obviously well above the guide. We see an expanding base of customers and a lot of momentum coming from gen AI as you noted. As part of this, we delivered -- what we delivered in Q4 was net new ARR -- was a record net new ARR in constant currency. Now specific to your question on Creative Cloud momentum and how to interpret the numbers that you see there, underlying all of this is very strong momentum because we delivered a record Creative Cloud new commercial subscriptions number in the year. So that is really the foundation and the base of customers coming in and really benefiting from not just what we get in this quarter, but also how we build on that going forward. So it really just sets us up well for FY '24. As you look at the numbers for Creative Cloud ARR, net-new ARR in the quarter, you have to look at it relative -- Q4 FY '23 relative to Q4 FY '22 as you mentioned. You need to consider that FY '22 had two pricing actions, that accrued to Creative Cloud that are much lower now in Q4 FY '23. So, if you normalize for the impact of the pricing that rolled off and the pricing that came on, Creative Cloud net new ARR in Q4 grew on a constant currency basis.\nShantanu Narayen: And Keith, just to punctuate the two points that David made -- David said, first, it was a record for Creative ARR as it related to subscriptions in Q4 of 2023 and Creative ARR would have grown if you had backed out the pricing. So, the business continues to be extremely healthy to your point.\nKeith Weiss: Excellent. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nAlex Zukin: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I guess maybe looking at next year, as we look at how much of the renewal base in Creative Cloud is potentially up for that type of the pricing uplift. And as we look at Acrobat, specifically the AI functionality that you're releasing into public beta. How should we think about the tailwind to both Creative Cloud from pricing and to Document Cloud, specifically from an AI product monetization perspective for '24 -- for calendar '24?\nDavid Wadhwani: Yeah. Happy to take that Alex, a lot packed into that question. So let me try to tease them apart. Let me first start with the question around FY '24 and impact of pricing. Before we jump straight into that I do want to take a bit of a step back and just remind everyone that Digital Media ARR is a mix of a few things, new subscriptions which as I mentioned we had a record number of new subscriptions in Q4, up-sell and cross-sell, which is transitioning people to higher plans from the plan that they're on. And then lastly offer optimization. And as you've noted in the last couple of years, we've really been broadening the number of offers we have all the way down from free price points to the all-apps price points, but even beyond that, we now have capabilities to sell add-ons to all-apps as well. And of course, all of this does include the pricing increases that you had mentioned where we've added more value. I do want to just stress, because I know there's a lot of attention on the pricing impact that we always have seen and continue to believe that the primary growth driver for ARR will be new subscriptions in '24. So, that's why we're so focused on the top-of-funnel and new customer acquisition. But specific to your question on pricing, you need to consider a few things. First, our recently announced pricing changes will impact less than half the Creative Cloud base. So there was a very specific question you asked, hopefully, that gives you the answer, but it also leaves us the opportunity to price in new value in the years ahead as we move forward. Second, the impact will be more visible in net new ARR in the back half of FY '24 as we lap the previous pricing actions that I was talking to Keith about from last year. And as we roll out the pricing over the next few quarters. So the second half of FY '24 we'll see more visibility into the benefits of that to net new ARR. Third, given that we're rolling out these prices across plans and across geos incrementally over the year, the benefit to ARR will actually be spread across FY '24 and FY '25. And fourth, if you really want to have sort of sharpen your pencil, the pricing impact on ARR in '24 is actually lower than the pricing impact was in '23 to Creative Cloud. So hopefully that gives you a sense, but again it comes back to this is why we're so excited about the momentum we're seeing in new subscriptions, which really bodes well for the business this year and in the long term. Hopefully, that gives you a pretty good sense on that. And then really quickly on Document Cloud, we're thrilled with the performance of Document Cloud, a lot of that comes down to our core strategy which has been around integrating the desktop, the web, and mobile into a single ecosystem. And really driving the monthly active usage of Document Cloud up through all of the product-led growth motions we have and converting people on the back-end of that. What we're really excited about as we bring the AI assistant to market, which by the way, as I mentioned, is now in private beta, expect it to come out in the next few months as a public beta and then, GA later in the year. But what we're really excited about there is being able to not just service that paid Acrobat based with that, but also start to bring that to the free reader base. So, lots of opportunity and excitement for the year ahead for Doc Cloud as well.\nAlex Zukin: Perfect. Thank you for the very fine point and answer.\nDavid Wadhwani: No problem.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nKirk Materne: Hi. Thanks and congrats on the quarter and happy holidays. David, I guess I'll go back to you again, in the commentary, you all talked about enterprise strength and specifically up-selling of Firefly and Express in your enterprise customer base. Can you just give us some more, I guess, qualitative color on what those discussions are like, are they lead -- is this part of the reason you're seeing sort of an uptick in new subscriptions in the enterprise, in particular? And then on Express. Can you just talk again about sort of what you're seeing in terms of leading indicators of that being an enterprise product that can continue to expand into fiscal '24. Thanks.\nDavid Wadhwani: Yeah. Maybe I'll start and then Anil can add because does crossover our two businesses. So with Firefly and Express, very excited about the momentum that we continue to see. You heard that we crossed 4.5 billion generations now, so we continue to see really, really strong adoption and usage of it. Partially as a standalone business, but also integrated into our Photoshop and Illustrator and these existing workflows. And we're starting to see a lot of interest, not just in the context of using it as part of those existing products, but also using it as part of the ecosystem within enterprises. So, we've been working with a number of customers to not just enable them with Firefly, which is the predominance of the growth that we're seeing in Q4 for enterprise adoption but also have a number of pilot customers already engaged around custom model extension, so that they can bring their own assets and their own content into what Firefly generates. Second, we're also enabling the ability to expose it through APIs, so they can build it into their existing workflows and third, we of course connecting it in tying it all into Adobe Express, which now also has its own Firefly and additional capabilities like things, so that you can not just sort of create content using Firefly, but then start to assemble it, start to schedule, social posts around it, start to do multi-language translations that -- those are all features that are already in there and then create a stakeholder workflow from people working in Photoshop to the marketers that are trying to post externally. So, that's where things get very interesting and exciting in terms of the connection we have with GenStudio and everything that Anil is doing.\nAnil Chakravarthy: Just building on that, GenStudio since we announced it at MAX, we've had a tremendous amount of interest both from enterprise customers like Henkel and Pepsi and Verizon, as well as a number of agencies as well. And primarily it goes back to what we discussed at Summit. The demand for content is expected to grow 5x over the next couple of years, and every brand in the world is looking at, hey, how can we speed up the production of quality on brand content, how can we let a number of other people in marketing, other areas of the company create their own content according to the standards -- enterprise standards and the combination of what we have in the Digital Experience portfolio like Adobe Experience Manager and assets as well as what we have in the Creative Cloud, especially around Express and Creative Cloud really let's enterprises, get that kind of agility and the cost-effectiveness of producing content at scale. So that's what we're seeing and we're seeing a tremendous amount of interest for that.\nShantanu Narayen: And maybe I'll just add a little bit to that, Kirk. I mean, I think the exciting thing about what people are doing is they're standardizing on Firefly and the fact that we have responsible generations for the entire enterprise. So the interest level has been around, how do we standardize that for all of the image or vector or other generations that they want to do for all the knowledge workers in the enterprise. So really good adoption of Firefly.\nKirk Materne: Thank you.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Karl Keirstead with UBS. Please go ahead.\nKarl Keirstead: Thanks. I'd like to ask about a different subject. And that's the creative Express product now that it's being sold into the enterprise. I'm wondering if you could offer some color on the adoption ramp, the competitiveness versus Canva and whether your plans around driving Express revenues versus driving user adoption have changed at all. Thank you.\nShantanu Narayen: Great. Yeah. Happy to take that. Express is off to a great start. As you remember, we went general availability in August with the latest version of it, it's been getting a lot of very, very positive reaction response. And frankly, since then in Q4 too, we've added a ton of new innovation. Firefly integration started with Text to Image and Text to Effects, but we also added Text to Template that will create a fully-formed template for you and generative fill, so you can iteratively change things on the fly. We now let you drawing paint on the campus -- canvas, we've given users much more video support. We've really built an incredible best-of-breed PDF support and workflow with Acrobat in there as well. Some of the other things that now start to bleed into the enterprise also, we have integrated social workflows so that people can schedule their post, we've enabled people to do auto-translations, so you can post to multiple geographies and languages. We've opened up our ecosystem for partner plug-ins and we have now over 50 extensions. And we've added enterprise features like AEM integration and template locking, so that the core, brand police in an organization can manage and make sure that their brand elements that they don't want changing are locked when you disseminate this more broadly. What we've seen is really. I think some very exciting broad-based benefits from this. One is, we've seen new trialists coming in, growing very quickly after this launch, which is exciting to see, we've seen education, users starting to adopt this very quickly as well, the Creative Cloud probe paid base has been coming on and growing very quickly in terms of their usage and then enterprise, as we talked about from a usage perspective and again, Express is a core part of how Anil and team are now selling GenStudio. And the last thing is like this is just setting up the momentum for the year to come. We have a mobile release coming out, which will be very exciting for users to be able to use this on the go. We have thousands of people already using that beta. We announced our Chromebooks partnership. So, anyone that buys a new Chromebook is going to have this. We have partnerships with folks like Wix for their workflows. We're going to be doing deeper integrations into Acrobat. So we are very excited about where this goes. That is a long way to answer a very simple question. We want a lot of people using this. So, our primary focus continues to be around broadening the top of funnel. Of course, as part of that, we are constantly and continually, as I mentioned, journeying people for upsell and cross-sell opportunities to the paid plan, and over to Creative Cloud and other products, but our primary focus continues to be adoption and broad proliferation.\nKarl Keirstead: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nBrad Zelnick: Great. Thanks very much. This is for Dan or maybe Anil. As we think about the momentum within the DX business, it's great to hear things like the 60% increase in your AEP, and native apps book of business, the strong net dollar retention. And you talked about overall strong year-end bookings, but what does it maybe about the pipeline ahead, bookings conversion or perhaps other factors that account for the degree of decel that you're guiding for into next year? Thanks.\nAnil Chakravarthy: Thanks, Brad. I mean we are really excited about this massive multi-year opportunity, if we would look at any enterprise customers around the world, everybody recognizes the long-term imperative of transforming their customer experiences. And we're seeing that in these transformational deals that we talked about. And as you mentioned, for example, with AEP, our first $100 million net new business quarter and ending with over $700 million in our annualized book of business. With that said, definitely we're seeing macroeconomic impact, just like other enterprise software companies are. Every customer looks at the total cost of deploying the software and then what it would take to get the payback and ROI. And as a result, there is definitely some scrutiny and caution there. But that said, if we look at going into next year, we do see the pipeline across both our industry verticals as well as our mid-market customers. And we continue to be the leader in the market and we did get that recognition from both analysts and customers.\nBrad Zelnick: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nBrent Thill: Dan, if you could just review the broader assumptions in your guide. I think there's still a little concern from the Street in terms of why you're guiding, where you're guiding relative to where the Street was at. And maybe just tying in Shantanu to the guidance, if you could just give us your topline view of -- do you feel like the environment's improving, do you think it's just stabilizing? Just any thoughts in terms of from a high level, what you think is happening as we go into next year?\nDan Durn: Yeah. So thanks for the question, Brent. When we take a look at the guide. If we think about where we're at, at this point in time as we're looking forward in FY '24, clearly we see a lot of momentum in the business, the company's engine of innovation has been incredibly strong. And you see the strong financial performance of the company. That's both from a top line standpoint, as well as profitability and cash-flow standpoint. So, clearly a lot of momentum around the business. As I think about where we sit today, we printed a 46.4% operating margin. As we look forward in to next year, we take into account everything we can see. As Shantanu said, we take the guidance seriously and we set expectations in a prudent way, there is an opportunity to do better than the expectations that we set. Clearly, the company is going to be driving towards that. As we think about the engine of innovation, we think the pipeline is strong, we're going to continue to invest in the drivers of growth. This company is going to orient towards growth. When I think about the investment profile, not only are we going to be disciplined. But we're going to continue to invest in those drivers of growth on the DX side. Anil talked about AEP and Apps strong book of business, strong growth, we're laying the groundwork and content supply chain with the GenStudio solution, scaling that motion, and engaging with customers to go from ideation, to creation to activation, delivering new technologies, products, AEM sites incorporating intelligence into those products. On the DME side, you can see it across the portfolio, AI assistant Acrobat, it's in private beta, and it's going to be in public beta in the coming months, you look at Firefly and Express, natively and deeply integrating these technologies throughout the product portfolio, there is going to be continual investment as it relates to that innovation. As you think about the momentum exiting this year and as you think about the guide into Q1, you can see that momentum continuing, get the operating margin up a little bit, and then throughout the year, as we said at our FA Day and the last year's earnings call, you can see a mid-40s expectation around operating margin for the company as we drive this investment cycle, as we drive leadership in our core markets and our key catalyst in the trends that are shaping those markets. So, again, taking a step back, it nets into account the macro that Anil talked about everything we see from a core business standpoint, and the investment profile that we're going to drive to lead, if there's an opportunity to do better than where we set those expectations we're certainly going to do it.\nShantanu Narayen: And maybe just to add to that, Brent, since you asked. First, let me clarify, there is nothing as it relates to the economic indicators that we saw anything that would give us cause for concern. So, let me start off by saying that, I think at our Investor Meeting, we told you that we would expect a strong quarter, I think you would acknowledge, we posted some really strong numbers and the momentum continues. And I think as it relates to Creative Cloud, it's going to be driven by new customer acquisition, which is the engine that's driven the business and maybe perhaps the sell-side looked at some of the pricing and put more of that in '24 then in '24 and '25 and that will spread out and perhaps they put a little bit more in what percentage of the base that impacts. So from my perspective, the good news about Creative is it's being driven by massive new adoption into the platform. On Document Cloud, really strong results. I think as Dan said, as we put the AI pack on there as well, that should help fuel more adoption and Digital Experience, I mean, I know that Brad also asked that question. I mean it's great to see the adoption of AEP and Apps. I mean, that is clearly the future of digital experiences, driving $100 million quarter, the $700 million in the annualized book of business, which I think will reflect the next-generation customer experience architecture. So we're feeling positive. And we're going go execute against that Brent. So, nothing that we see on the horizon would tell us either from the economic or competition, that we're not poised to have another great year and profitability as well, I mean, look at the numbers that we posted both in terms of Q4, as well as for fiscal '24 and that is that does not in any way mean that we're not going to invest in all of the cloud and the foundation models. So I feel really good.\nDan Durn: And then just one thing to add, Brent, If we were here a year ago, the expectations going into the year where FX was going to be a pretty decent headwind to the performance, you see that in the way we've reported our results and then compare it to a constant-currency basis. We started with a pretty decent spread between the as-reported numbers in constant-currency in Q1. By the time we got to Q4, you saw that spread compress, as I look forward into FY '24, it's more of a neutral footing to maybe a slight headwind. Too early to really call it with precision, but I see that setup being slightly different. And maybe just a slight headwind versus what we were seeing a year ago.\nBrent Thill: Thanks for the color.\nOperator: We'll will take our next question from Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Please go ahead.\nJay Vleeschhouwer: Yeah. Thank you. You noted the strength in RPO in the quarter, including the record sequential increase. Can you talk about how you're thinking about RPO for fiscal '24, would you expect it to continue to be able to outgrow revenue growth by several points as you did in fiscal '23 and perhaps talk about the ingredients that will continue to drive RPO, either by segment or any other considerations that you'd like to talk about in that.\nShantanu Narayen: Yeah. Thanks, Jay. As I pull some of the threads together that we've heard on this call. Anil, talked about large transformational deals being the platform of choice with customer experience management, simultaneously driving topline and bottom-line productivity and the investments around driving those are an imperative in the market. We see a similar dynamic with the new technologies that we're bringing to market on the DME side at the business, we're streaming seeing strong pull from the enterprise. And so as I net out that environment and our performance against that opportunity, it goes to produce the type of sequential RPO progression that we saw Q3 to Q4. Every quarter won't be that large, but the backdrop around that dynamic for the company given the setup we see, it should be another strong year for RPO throughout the year.\nJay Vleeschhouwer: Thank you.\nShantanu Narayen: Operator. We're getting close to the top of the hour. We'll take two more questions and then we'll wrap up. Thanks.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Saket Kalia with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nSaket Kalia: Okay. Great. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on a nice quarter. David maybe for you, I had a question just on Firefly and the subscription packets. I know that the commercial model for commercial -- I'm sorry, for Firefly credit packets, really just started about six weeks ago. But are there any early observations that you've seen just on customers' willingness to add those packets, or maybe how they're consuming the initial credit allocation that they get with the Creative Cloud subscription?\nDavid Wadhwani: Yeah. Happy to take that. First of all I think philosophically, going back to what we said at the investor meeting at MAX, our primary focus here is to drive usage of the generative capabilities and you see that with the 4.5 billion images generated, that strategy is working. Secondly, we price the generative packs -- sorry, we integrated the generative capabilities and credits directly into our paid plans with the Express intent of driving adoption of the paid subscription plans and getting broad proliferation of the ability to use those. And what we are seeing is heavy usage within those paid plans. I think as we've mentioned in the past. I think I mentioned earlier today as well, Generative Fill, for example in Photoshop is the fastest-growing feature that we've put into Photoshop in recent memory. So the usage is great, the utilization is great. I don't personally expect the generative packs to have a large impact in the short-term, other than to drive more usage more customers to our paid existing subscription plans. But what will happen over the course of the year, in the next few years is that we will be integrating more and more generative capabilities into the existing product workflows. And that will drive and we'll be integrating capabilities like video generation, which will cost more than one generation and that will drive a natural inflation in that market and that will become a driver for growth subsequently. But this year is really primarily focused on getting people into the right paid plans of our flagship applications, our Adobe Express, and then drive usage in that sense. And then as that happens, the rest will take care of itself in the years ahead.\nSaket Kalia: Makes sense. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: We'll take our final question from Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Please go ahead.\nMark Moerdler: Thank you for squeezing me in. I really do appreciate. Dan, I'd like to look a little bit at MAX we discussed how excited you were on Firefly and how it drives Creative Cloud seed and paid seed adoption. Now that you had a bit of time in market, can you explain how you think about how this will drive the paid seed growth, is it how strong it could be and should we expect to seeds going to be lower unit price because they're going to be entry-level, what do you think that we will get offset by these higher-priced Firefly driven sales into the enterprise. Thank you.\nDan Durn: Yeah. Thanks, Mark. I think at the core of bringing this technology to life, as a standalone application to drive an ideation part of the process, but value in deeply integrating these capabilities into the flagship applications and the workflows that define the creation process, it gives us a lot of surface area with customers and meeting them where they are in their particular needs and use-case specific needs. And so bringing people efficiently top of funnel, establishing the segmentation across that product portfolio, driving efficiency into the creation process and allowing the velocity to enter the ideation, creation, activation and then instrumentation of that to really refine how companies engage with customers. So, it lays the groundwork for us to touch more customers where they are in the ecosystem, bring them on board in a use-case specific way and then take them on digital journeys which is something the company has very skilled at with our D-DOM to cross-sell and upsell over the life of their engagement with our ecosystem.\nAnil Chakravarthy: From a product perspective, when you think about it, Mark, for us, the biggest thing that we want to do is, how do we further make our products accessible, fun and affordable for increasing set of customers and I think Firefly is one of those inflection points that will help everybody get over the blank screen fear that they have and so first, as you think about Firefly as an ideation and people just coming and want to have creative inspiration. This is, whether you're an individual user, whether you're agencies, we're seeing a lot of adoption of Firefly to just start the entire Creative process and that sort of brings them as an on-ramp into Express, which would be the other part. Express is certainly the introductory pricing, the ability to get millions more into the fold and the ability, right now, it used to be that Express and other offerings in that is to all worry about, do I have the right templates. Well, AI is going to completely change that, we have our own models and so Firefly will allow anybody to take whatever creative idea that they have and make that available, so I think Firefly really helps with the Express offering. On the Creative Cloud, David mentioned this. I mean if you look at the adoption of that functionality and usage, that's being driven, whether it's in Photoshop right now, Illustrator as we add video, both in terms of providing greater value and we certainly will therefore have the uplift in pricing as well as the retentive ability for Firefly. That's where I think you're going to see a lot of the really interesting aspects of how Firefly will drive both adoption as well as monetization. And then if you go at the other end of the spectrum to the enterprise, GenStudio, every single marketer that I know and CFO and CMO, are all worried about how much am I spending on data, how do I get agility in my campaigns and the fact that Firefly is integrated into both Express as well as when we do the custom models for them, so they can upload their own models and then have the brand consistency that they want. So, Firefly really is the fact that we have our own models. A great catalyst for our business, all across the spectrum and the usage and the adoption shows that in emerging markets, as people there in emerging markets are increasingly used to create variance of content and localization of content, that's where we are also seeing a tremendous usage of these particular technologies. So really exciting. And then, you take the same technology that we have in Creative and think about its impact in both Document Cloud when we do that and the ability to have summaries and have conversational interfaces with PDF, thereby making every single PDF as David again said, both for communication, collaboration and creation far more compelling. I think you're going to see that same kind of uplift in usage and therefore monetization on the Acrobat side. And since it was the last question. I mean, for us, we look at FY '23, and we're really proud what we were able to accomplish across all spectrums topline revenue, RPO and driving book of business, Creative Cloud, Document Cloud, and Experience Cloud and profitability, and we think '24 is going to be exactly more of the same, which is continuing to drive great innovation, great product growth, great profitability. Clearly, I think there has been a set of questions around the Digital Media ARR and what I'll take is on that and we're extremely confident about how that continues to be a growth business and perhaps the pricing impact was overestimated. And as we said, this is again new growth business and it will be a multi-year pricing benefit for us as we think about the uplift that we have. So we're really pleased. We appreciate you being on the call. And like many of you wished us, happy holidays and we hope to see you soon. Thank you for joining us.\nShantanu Narayen: Thanks, everyone. Happy holidays. This concludes the call.\nOperator: Once again, this concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation.

We are excited about the potential to reimagine the content supply chain for all businesses through the integration of our clouds, enabling the delivery of personalized and engaging customer experiences. Our strategy to unleash creativity for all, accelerate document productivity and power digital businesses is driving our growth across every geography. By delivering innovative technology platforms and services, we continue to advance our industry leadership and delight a growing universe of customers. I'll now turn it over to David to share more about our momentum in the Digital Media business.\nDavid Wadhwani: Thanks, Shantanu. Hello, everyone. In Q3, we achieved net new Digital Media ARR of $464 million and revenue of $3.59 billion, which grew 14% year-over-year, driven by strength in both our Creative and Document businesses. On the creative side, digital content creation and consumption are exploding across every creative category, customer segment and media type. Creative Cloud is the leading creativity platform, offering a comprehensive portfolio of products and services for every discipline across imaging, photography, design, video, animation and 3D. We're excited about the growth we are driving with our creative flagship products, and with Adobe Express, our AI-first, all-in-one creativity app that makes it fast, easy and fun for any user to design and share standout content. Yesterday's announcements highlighted several advances to our creative business: First, after an unprecedented beta that saw over 2 billion images generated, Adobe Firefly models and the Firefly web application are now commercially available. Firefly supports text prompts in over 100 languages and enables users around the world to create content that is designed to be safe for commercial use. We will continue to train and release new Firefly foundation models in areas where we have rich datasets and expertise, such as imaging, vector, video, design, 3D and more. Second, Adobe Firefly-powered features are now natively integrated into several Creative Cloud apps, including Generative Fill and Generative Expand in Photoshop, Generative Recolor in Illustrator, and Text to Image and Text Effects in Adobe Express. These deep integrations deliver more creative power than ever before to customers, enabling them to experiment, ideate, and create in completely new ways. Third, Adobe Firefly for Enterprise is now generally available for businesses to enable both creative teams and knowledge workers to confidently deploy AI-generated content. Adobe will empower customers to create custom models using proprietary assets to generate branded content and offer access to Firefly APIs so customers can embed the power of Firefly into their own content creation and automation workflows. And finally, we announced subscription offerings including new generative AI credits with the goal of enabling broad access and user adoption. Generative Credits are tokens that enable customers to turn text-based prompts into images, vectors and text effects with other content types to follow. Free and trial plans include a small number of monthly fast Generative Credits and will expose a broad base of prospects to the power of Adobe's generative AI, expanding our top-of-funnel. Paid Firefly, Express and Creative Cloud plans will include a further allocation of fast Generative Credits. After the plan-specific number of Generative Credits is reached, users will have an opportunity to buy additional fast Generative Credit subscription packs. In Q3, we added $332 million of Creative ARR and achieved $2.91 billion of revenue, growing 14% year-over-year. Business highlights include: The integration of Firefly into Photoshop and Illustrator. Over 3 million users have downloaded the Photoshop and Illustrator beta releases. The general availability of Adobe Express now includes support for editing and posting designs, videos, images, PDFs, presentations and more. Express features include Firefly-powered Text to Image and Text Effects. Express is already being used by millions of people globally. New AI and 3D features in Premiere Pro and After Effects, including Enhance Speech and Text-Based Editing in Premiere Pro and a new 3D workspace in After Effects. The Text-Based Editing feature in Premiere Pro received the 2023 Hollywood Professional Association Award for Engineering Excellence. New Lightroom mobile now integrates directly with the camera roll and introduced a streamlined interface to make editing even easier on the go. The introduction of new video assets in Adobe Stock and strong product-led growth motions, drove a record Q3 for the Stock business. Key customer wins include Amazon, Havas, Paramount, SAP, Southern Graphics, Take-Two Interactive and U.S. Department of Energy. As we have continued to add new applications and delivered innovations across our creative offerings, we announced price updates for certain Creative Cloud plans across the Americas and Europe, starting November 1, 2023. In addition to being a growth driver in the Creative Cloud business, Acrobat and PDF continue to power the Document Cloud business. Whether it's a sales contract, legal document or a back-to-school form, seamless document workflows across every device and platform are more important than ever for all of us to be productive in our professional and personal lives. Document Cloud is powering document productivity and automation across the web, desktop and mobile. In Q3, we achieved Document Cloud revenue of $685 million, growing 15% year-over-year. We added $132 million of net new Document Cloud ARR, with ending ARR growing 22% year-over-year in constant currency. Business highlights include: Significant growth in monthly active users across web, mobile, and embedded third-party app ecosystems, reflecting our growing top of funnel and the effectiveness of our product-led growth execution. Strong mobile momentum reflecting the value of Acrobat as an essential productivity application on mobile devices. Adoption of Acrobat and Acrobat Sign through increased link sharing for enhanced collaboration and approval workflows. Enhanced PDF workflows across Acrobat and Express making it seamless to create visually stunning PDFs. A new Adobe PDF Electronic Seal API, which is a cloud-based, end-to-end solution for applying electronic seals on PDFs at enterprise scale. Key customer wins include Citibank, GlaxoSmithKline, Emerson Electric, Morgan Stanley and Volkswagen. We continue to be excited about the pending Figma acquisition, which will reimagine the future of creativity and productivity. We remain engaged with regulators and have confidence in the merits of the case. We look forward to hosting Adobe MAX, the world's largest creativity conference, next month in Los Angeles, where we will welcome 10,000 members of our global community and engage with hundreds of thousands more online. We will hear from inspiring creators and unveil innovations across Creative Cloud, Firefly and Express. In summary, we are excited about the pace of innovations across our Digital Media products and continued execution across multiple growth drivers. I'll now pass it to Anil.\nAnil Chakravarthy: Thanks, David. Hello, everyone. Every company sees digital as an opportunity to drive experience-led growth. As I've spent time with customers across the world, it's clear that they are prioritizing investments in customer experience management technology to improve customer acquisition, engagement, retention and operational efficiency. We are driving revenue growth across content and commerce, customer journeys, data insights and audiences and marketing workflows, leveraging the Adobe Experience Platform, demonstrating the strength of our business. Brands around the globe are working with Adobe to accelerate personalization at scale through generative AI. With the announcement of Adobe GenStudio, we are revolutionizing the entire content supply chain by simplifying the creation-to-activation process with generative AI capabilities and intelligent automation. Marketers and creative teams will now be able to create and modify commercially safe content to increase the scale and speed at which experiences are delivered. In Q3, we continued to drive strong growth in our Experience Cloud business, achieving $1.23 billion in revenue, representing 11% year-over-year growth, as a growing number of enterprises turned to Adobe as their trusted partner for customer experience management. Subscription revenue was $1.1 billion, representing 13% year-over-year growth. Adobe Experience Cloud delivers predictive, personalized, real-time digital experiences, from acquisition to monetization to retention. We are driving strong enterprise adoption of Adobe Experience Platform, and native apps including Real-Time CDP, Adobe Journey Optimizer and Customer Journey Analytics. For example, the Coca-Cola Company is leveraging Adobe Real-Time CDP and Adobe Journey Optimizer to bring together 98 million customer profiles globally into a single CDP to quickly deliver personalized campaigns and experiences. smart Europe, an all-electric automotive brand, is using Adobe Experience Cloud to offer customers the ability to personalize their vehicle purchases through the integration of Adobe Workfront, Adobe Creative Cloud and Adobe Experience Manager. Business highlights include: Strong momentum across AEP and native apps with the total book of business surpassing $600 million during the quarter. Adobe Journey Optimizer book of business more than doubled year-over-year as customers increasingly drive omnichannel personalization and engagement. Continued innovation in Adobe Experience Manager with AEM Assets now natively integrated with Firefly and Express, enabling any employee across an organization to generate and reuse beautiful on-brand content. Growth of our Workfront business, reflecting our ability to serve the workflow and collaboration needs of enterprise customers and agencies. In Q3, we added Havas to the growing list of top agencies standardizing on Adobe for their content supply chain. Expanded strategic partnership with Amazon. Given customer demand, we will jointly deliver AEP on AWS and Amazon will deploy Experience Cloud across their enterprise. Adobe's leadership in Content Management Systems was recognized across three industry analyst reports, including the IDC MarketScape for Full-stack Content Management Systems, the IDC MarketScape for Hybrid Headless CMS and the Forrester Wave for Content Management Systems. Adobe was also named a Leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Digital Commerce as well as the IDC MarketScape for OmniChannel Marketing Platforms for B2C Enterprises. Key customer wins include Amazon, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Florida, Dollar General, Havas, Intuit, IRS, Jet2.com, Lufthansa, Macy's, MSC Cruises, Novo Nordisk and SAP. These and other customers continue to prioritize investments in customer experience management solutions despite increased scrutiny of enterprise IT spend. Our solutions enable enterprises to simultaneously achieve the twin goals of driving new customer acquisition and serving existing customers to deliver profitable growth. Adobe is well positioned to keep winning with our differentiated offerings, track record of innovations and ability to drive ROI for companies across industries. We're looking forward to a strong close to the year. I will now pass it to Dan.\nDan Durn: Thanks, Anil. Today I will start by summarizing Adobe's performance in Q3 fiscal 2023, highlighting growth drivers across our businesses, and I'll finish with financial targets. Adobe's performance in Q3 demonstrates something that makes us exceptional, the combination of growth and profitability. In fact, at Adobe, rather than talking about trade-offs between growth or profitability, we call it an \"and\" statement. Growth and profitability is not new for us, we have been delivering both for a very long time and it is at the core of our operating philosophy. It all starts with prioritization, innovation and a sharp focus on execution. This philosophy shines through in our Q3 results. We are investing in technology platforms, global campaigns to attract and engage millions of customers and recruiting the best and brightest people in our industry. While doing that, Adobe is driving performance on margin and earnings, demonstrating what a special company we are. In Q3, Adobe achieved revenue of $4.89 billion, which represents 10% year-over-year growth, or 13% in constant currency. GAAP diluted earnings per share was $3.05, up 26% year-over-year, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $4.09, up 20% year-over-year. Other business and financial highlights included: Digital Media revenue of $3.59 billion; net new Digital Media ARR of $464 million; Digital Experience revenue of $1.23 billion; cash flows from operations of $1.87 billion; RPO of $15.72 billion exiting the quarter; and repurchasing approximately 2.1 million shares of our stock during the quarter. In our Digital Media segment, we achieved Q3 revenue of $3.59 billion, which represents 11% year-over-year growth, or 14% in constant currency. We added $464 million of net new ARR in the quarter, our strongest Q3 on record, exiting the quarter with $14.60 billion of Digital Media ARR, growing 15% year-over-year in constant currency. We achieved Creative revenue of $2.91 billion, which represents 11% year-over-year growth, or 14% in constant currency. We added $332 million of net new Creative ARR in Q3, with strong demand across our offerings. Third quarter Creative growth drivers included: new user growth across geographies, customer segments and Creative offerings, driven by innovation and targeted campaigns utilizing insights from our data-driven operating model; outstanding top-of-funnel performance resulting from viral community excitement and success of our product-led growth strategy, driving traffic to Adobe.com; single app subscriptions for Photoshop driven by interest in the magic of Firefly, Generative Fill and Generative Expand; another great quarter for value-added services, including strong customer demand for Adobe Stock; continued customer adoption of Acrobat CC; strong engagement and retention across customer segments; and success in the enterprise, driven by transformational ETLAs that span the entire Creative portfolio, including CC All Apps for creative teams, Express for knowledge workers, Frame for collaboration, and Adobe Stock and Firefly for content. Adobe achieved Document Cloud revenue of $685 million, which represents 13% year-over-year growth, or 15% in constant currency, and we added $132 million of net new Document Cloud ARR in the quarter. Third quarter Document Cloud growth drivers included: success with new customer acquisition through our Reader and Acrobat web funnels and distribution partners, with monthly active users up over 70% year-over-year for Acrobat web; strong demand for Acrobat subscriptions across customer segments and geographies, driven by targeted offers; strength in monetization from Acrobat mobile, which grew ending ARR over 30% year-over-year in constant currency, driven by product innovation and conversion; and traction in B2B, with strong unit demand for our Team offering through the reseller and direct routes to market. Turning to our Digital Experience segment, in Q3, we achieved revenue of $1.23 billion, which represents 10% year-over-year growth, or 11% in constant currency. Q3 subscription revenue was $1.10 billion, which represents 12% year-over-year growth, or 13% in constant currency. Third quarter Digital Experience growth drivers included: demand for our Adobe Experience Platform and native applications, including Real-Time CDP, Customer Journey Analytics and Adobe Journey Optimizer. In Q3, subscription revenue for AEP and Apps grew 60% year-over-year; strength in Content and Commerce, with Adobe Experience Manager continuing to set the standard for enterprise content management; growth of our Workfront business, as workflow and collaboration are essential components of an enterprise content supply chain solution; strong retention rates in the quarter, as we continue to focus on value realization to our Digital Experience customers; and continued momentum in transformational platform deals with large enterprises adopting our end-to-end suite of applications. Adobe's effective tax rate in Q3 was 19.5% on a GAAP basis and 18.5% on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP tax rate came in lower than expected due to tax benefits associated with the vesting of share-based payments in the quarter. RPO exiting the quarter was $15.72 billion, growing 11% year-over-year, or 13% when adjusting for a 2% FX headwind. Our ending cash and short-term investment position exiting Q3 was $7.52 billion, and cash flows from operations in the quarter were $1.87 billion. In Q3, we entered into $1 billion share repurchase agreement, and we currently have $3.15 billion remaining of our $15 billion authorization granted in December 2020. Factoring in current macroeconomic conditions and year-end seasonal strength, for Q4, we are targeting: total Adobe revenue of $4.975 billion to $5.025 billion; Digital Media net new ARR of approximately $520 million; Digital Media segment revenue of $3.67 billion to $3.70 billion; Digital Experience segment revenue of $1.25 billion to $1.27 billion; Digital Experience subscription revenue of $1.11 billion to $1.13 billion; tax rate of approximately 18% on a GAAP basis and 18.5% on a non-GAAP basis; GAAP earnings per share of $3.10 to $3.15; and non-GAAP earnings per share of $4.10 to $4.15. Q3 was a great quarter for Adobe, and I couldn't be more pleased with how the company is positioned to continue to deliver for our customers and investors. We're looking forward to our Investor Meeting at Adobe MAX on October 10, where we'll do a deep dive into our AI innovation. I hope to see you there. Shantanu, back to you.\nShantanu Narayen: Thanks, Dan. Adobe's strong Q3 results are a reflection of our team's exceptional execution. We recently lost our beloved co-founder John Warnock. John's brilliance and innovations changed the world. He was one of the greatest inventors of our generation and an inspiration to the technology industry. While we miss him tremendously, it gives me great comfort knowing that John was so proud of all of the innovation Adobe continues to deliver. As someone who shares John's passion for product and innovation, I'm exceptionally energized by the technology platforms we are delivering with AI at the center across our three clouds to delight customers. Our brand, technology and our talented employees position us for a strong close to the year and continued growth in the decades to come. Adobe's best days are ahead of us. Thank you. We will now take questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.\nKeith Weiss: Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question and really nice quarter. Dan, actually a margin question, for you. And kind of a riddle that, like, we've been thinking about. We've been told generative AI is really expensive to run. The inference and training costs are really high. You guys have been running a beta for a while, 2 million images generated. There's a lot of functionality already in the product. And your operating margins are up. Your gross margins are up on a year-on-year basis. So, how are you able to do that? Like, where are these costs going, if you will? And on a go-forward basis, if all this stuff becomes generally available, how should we think about that gross margin impact or the overall margin impact of generative AI on a go-forward basis? Thank you.\nDan Durn: Yeah. Thanks, Keith. So, as you rightfully point out, the engine of innovation at the company is really strong. A lot of exciting announcements this week, but we've been at this now a year, bringing the magic of generative AI and Firefly to life. And we're just getting started from an innovation standpoint. Over the last six months, we've been live with the beta. And as you point out, we've generated -- our customers have generated over 2 billion images. And I know it's not lost on people. All this has done while we're delivering strong margins. But when we take a step back and think about these technologies, we have investments from a COGS standpoint, inferencing, content, from an R&D standpoint, training, creating foundation models, and David alluded to it in his prepared comments, the image model for Firefly family of models is out. But we're going to bring other media types to market as well. So, we're making substantive investments. When I go back to the framing of my prepared comments, we really have a fundamental operating philosophy that's been alive at the company for a long time: growth and profitability. We're going to prioritize, we're going to innovate, and we're going to execute with rigor, and you see that coming through in all of the financial results of the company. As we think about going -- the profile going forward, what I'll come back to is, is when we initially set fiscal 2023 targets, implicit in those targets was a 44.5% operating margin. If you think about how we just guided Q4, where we've got these four great new products and these technologies infused into the product lineup, and all of the support we're going to do as we roll these out in our MAX conference down in L.A. again to keep the enthusiasm with the customer base building, implicit in that guide is an operating margin of around 45.5%. So, as you think about us leading this industry, leading the inflection that's unfolding in front of us, that mid-40%s number we think is the right ballpark to think about the margin structure of the company as we continue to drive this technology and leadership. Looking forward to the Q4 earnings call where we will share more about our fiscal 2024 targets.\nShantanu Narayen: And maybe Keith, just 30 seconds to add to that, for investors like you who want to make sure we're not in any way not investing in the future, we are investing on training for 3D, for video, for new forms of imaging and vectors. So, what we are confident is while we continue to invest in that, the scrutiny that Dan and his team have on other expenses, that we can continue to drive top-line growth as well as cash flow and EPS. So, I think we're unique in that respect.\nKeith Weiss: Definitely. Very impressive, guys. Thank you so much for taking the question.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs.\nKash Rangan: Sorry to hear of John Warnock's passing. My condolences. But congrats on the quarter. As we look at the pricing model for generative AI products which are based on consumption, do you think that these -- rather, how additive do you think the generative AI offerings will be to the growth profile of the company going forward? And also one for Dan. When you look at your Q4 guidance, are you contemplating -- it looks like it's not largely changed versus the Street's prior expectations. Are we not embedding any opportunities to show what the generative AI products can do? Because they seem to be largely incremental to what had been contemplated when you first gave guidance fall of last year. Thank you so much.\nShantanu Narayen: Well, Kash, maybe David and I can take the first parts of the question. And just again, for everybody on the call, I think to summarize the new offerings that we have, we've announced that we have a Firefly subscription. So, you can use a free trial number of credits, and after that, you can actually subscribe to Firefly. We have Adobe Express, which now includes an allocation of Firefly. We certainly have the Creative Cloud products and Photoshop and Illustrator that have it. We have Generation Credit Packs, and we have GenStudio for the Enterprise and to be able to deal with it. So first, I just wanted to make sure that you recognized the tremendous innovation that we're delivering associated with that. And as you know, one of the things that we have done is to really focus on both new user acquisition, which is going to be driven across all of those offerings, as well as with the price increase, given there is an allocation associated with it for existing customers, they will start to see that as they roll over and they have to renew their subscription. So, I just wanted to set that bit, and maybe then I'll ask David to add a little bit about each of these and how we see that play out.\nDavid Wadhwani: Yeah, thanks, Shantanu. Yeah, as Shantanu said, we look at the business implications of this through those two lenses: new user adoption, first and foremost, and then sort of opportunity to continue to grow the existing book of business. On the new user side, we've said this for years, our focus continues to be on proliferation. We believe that we have a massive number of users in front of us. We continue to have our primary focus being net user adds and subscribers. And so, the goal here in proliferation is to get the right value to the right audience at the right price. And if I think about the four new offerings that Shantanu teed up, I think two of them are primed to maybe be on the earlier side of that. First, on the individual side, Express. It's been in the market for over a year now, and the new release of Express is a massive step forward in terms of the abilities that it has, both -- everything from performance to support for a broader set of things beyond design, into video and into illustration, into PDF and document workflows. So, there's just a tremendous amount of new value that we've added, including generative AI into that. So, we think that Express will be an early indicator of that success that we're talking about. The second one is the work that we're doing in the DME business in conjunction with Anil on the DX business around enterprises, so GenStudio, and enabling the broad base of marketers to actually use Express in conjunction with the Creative Studio teams using Creative Cloud to really accelerate their use of and creation of content. So that really -- in the context of the short-term contributors, we think that will be really meaningful. We also expect that -- as we do this and drive new users, we expect to see a lot of new users come into the free plans. And that's going to take a little time to ramp. We'll bring them into the Adobe family, get them using the products, and ramp them to greater value over time. So, first and foremost, proliferation on new users. The second thing is going to be on the book of business. And here, we're -- basically, the pricing changes. Just as a reminder, they have a rolling impact. We're going to start them late in Q4. And we're going to start it in certain geos only. And then, we're going to have a measured rollout in new countries over the course of the next couple of years. And then certainly also as it relates to enterprise customers, the renewal timing will probably take about three years, given the multi-year contracts that we have in place. So, net-net, we see this truly as a seminal moment for how we're going to grow the business, but it's going to take a few years to play out, and we're really excited about sort of what this means for bringing new customers into the franchise.\nShantanu Narayen: And maybe Kash, just to then tie that all together, in terms of the numbers that we've given for Digital Media ARR, because you asked the question from the beginning of the year, remember, I think we guided to $1.65 billion, if you look at what it is even with our Q4 guide that I think $200 million more than that, $1.86 billion or something to that effect. And since we guided in Q3, for Q3 and Q4, $100 million. So, we continue to be really confident and we're excited about the roadmap.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Saket Kalia with Barclays.\nSaket Kalia: Okay, great. Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question, and congrats on a great quarter and outlook. Anil, actually my question is for you. Obviously, a lot to talk about with Firefly in the Digital Media business. And it's very clearly a revenue opportunity there. I'm wondering how you think about the generative AI roadmap or revenue opportunity in the Digital Experience part of the business. I know we talked about the content supply chain, but how do you think about the future of generative AI in your business?\nAnil Chakravarthy: Yeah, thanks, Saket. Shantanu and David already talked about the Adobe GenStudio, and we're really excited about that. This is a unique opportunity, as you said, for enterprises to really create personalized content and drive efficiencies as well in -- through automation and efficiency. When you look at the entire chain of what enterprises go through, from content creation, production, workflow, and then activation through DX, through all the apps we have on our platform, we have the unique opportunity to do that. We already have deployed it within Adobe for our own Photoshop campaign. And we're working with a number of agencies and customers to do that. So, this is a big net new opportunity for us with Adobe GenStudio. We're also working on generative AI for other DX applications as well. And at the investor meeting in October, we'll share more details. But we see a similar opportunity with generative AI to bring together the ability for a number of users across marketing departments or organizations to be able to use the Adobe Experience platform and apps and it'll act as a co-pilot to accelerate the use cases that they bring to life. So, we'll share more about that at the investor meeting.\nShantanu Narayen: Saket, maybe, just to give Anil and the team a lot of credit for what they actually accomplished in Q3 as well, the wins in Q3 in the enterprise actually included a lot of the components of GenStudio, both in the Digital Media as well as in the Digital Experience. So, certainly the transformational deals that we're talking about, a big part of that is the synergy between the two clouds. So, I wanted to point that out as well.\nDavid Wadhwani: And if I could actually just add one quick thing is that the GenStudio work that Anil team has been doing, we've actually been using that within the Digital Media business already to release some of the campaigns that we've released this quarter. So, it's one of these things that it's great to see the impact it's having on our business, and that becomes a selling point for other businesses too.\nSaket Kalia: Great to hear. Thanks.\nOperator: And moving on to Gregg Moskowitz with Mizuho.\nGregg Moskowitz: Hey, thank you for taking the question. Congratulations as well on a strong quarter. So, when I look at Firefly, the amount of image generation in a six-month period is clearly pretty stunning. I'm just wondering if you're able to provide any additional color, whether it be monthly active users or some other metric that may additionally help all of us gauge the improvements that Firefly is driving to your engagement level, to your top-of-funnel, et cetera? Thank you.\nDavid Wadhwani: Yeah, happy to talk about that. It's been a remarkable few months. I mean, we've said a few things. First is that the viral excitement that we saw because of Firefly on social has been hugely beneficial and it's certainly driven a lot of top-of-funnel opportunity for us. In addition to that, one of the things that we were very excited about is when we integrated it into our CreativePro applications, Illustrator and Photoshop primarily, we saw over 3 million downloads of those betas -- beta applications, which is something we've never seen before. That gives you a sense of like how thirsty the existing customer base is for the generative capabilities that we have as well. And lastly, one of the things that we're very excited about, and we obviously track very carefully, is what does this do in terms of giving us access to new users that don't typically come to Adobe. And both Express and Firefly, and in particular the integration of Firefly and Express, has been a real accelerant to that. So, it's been nice to see us not just getting excitement within the current base, but seeing millions of other users coming in, that would not have typically come to Adobe for a product and then giving -- and starting their journey with Adobe through Firefly and Express.\nShantanu Narayen: Two other maybe financial indicators to that, Gregg, are first the Photoshop Single App, and I think Dan referred to that. Even in the beta, that actually drove a lot of Photoshop Single App and the early indicators of how that also benefits retention in the entire book of business. So both of those are also good financial indicators of the potential of AI.\nGregg Moskowitz: Great. Thank you, both.\nOperator: And we have a question from Brad Sills with Bank of America.\nBrad Sills: Wonderful. Thank you so much for taking my question. I wanted to ask about a comment that I think David made earlier in the call where you're working hard to make Firefly the option for content design to be safe. I would love to double click on that, understand a little bit, how is Adobe the safe option, and how is the company making this Firefly in this new generative frontier the safe option for enterprises?\nDavid Wadhwani: Yeah. So from the very beginning of Firefly, we took a very different approach to how we were doing generative. We started by looking at and working off the Adobe Stock base, which are contents that are licensed and very clearly we have the rights to use. And we looked at other repositories of content where they didn't have any restrictions on usage, and we've pulled that in. So, everything that we've trained on has gone through some form of moderation and has been cleared by our own legal teams for use in training. And what that means is that the content that we generate is, by definition, content that isn't then stepping on anyone else's brand and/or leveraging content that wasn't intended to be used in this way. So that's the foundation of what we've done. We've gone further than that, of course, and we've now actually -- we've been working with our Stock contributors. We've announced, in fact, yesterday we had our first payout of contributions to contributors that have been participating and adding Stock for the AI training. And we're able to leverage that base very effectively, so that if we see that we need additional training content, we can put a call to action, call for content out to them, and they're able to bring content to Adobe in a fully licensed way. So, for example, earlier this quarter, we decided that we needed a million new images of crowd scenes. And so, we put a call to action out. We were able to gather that content in. But it's fully licensed and fully moderated in terms of what comes in. So as a result, all of the content we generate is safe for commercial use. The second thing is that because of that, we're able to go to market and also indemnify customers in terms of how they're actually leveraging that content and using it for content that's being generated. And so, enterprise customers find that to be very important as we bring that in, not just in the context of Firefly standalone, but we integrate it into our Creative Cloud applications and Express applications as well. So, the whole ecosystem has been built on that. And the last thing I'll say is we've been very focused on fair generation. So, we look intentionally for diversity of people that are generated and we're looking to make sure that the content we generate doesn't create or cause any harm. And all those things are really good business decisions and differentiate us from others.\nBrad Sills: Great to hear. Thanks, David.\nOperator: And we have a question from Keith Bachman with BMO Capital Markets.\nKeith Bachman: Yes, thank you. I wanted to go back -- David, I wanted to hear your perspective on kind of the third cloud, the Document Cloud, if you will, as we look out over the next 12 months. And the spirit of the question is there's a lot of attention, appropriately so, given Firefly and whatnot, and perhaps even lending itself in the Experience Cloud. But does gen AI provide any tailwinds associated with the Document Cloud, or is it sort of the existing drivers that will help contribute to growth as we look at next year? But any just kind of -- what are the key things that we should be thinking about for Document Cloud? Many thanks.\nDavid Wadhwani: Yeah. First of all, we are very happy with the quarter Doc Cloud had. The ending book of business grew 22% in constant currency. And the strength of that is really driven based on top-of-funnel growth. So, Acrobat on the web had a phenomenal year-over-year growth rate. We've been working very actively to get Acrobat sort of deployed with -- as plugins within the browsers. We've got a great -- we've been doing a lot of product-led growth work in the products themselves to drive link sharing, so that more and more people are not just using our products, but as they share links, we're actually able to capture more people and build growth loops. Signatures has been also doing incredibly well. So, as we've got this broad-based proliferation of our surfaces that are available and continue to grow in terms of both free and paid usage, it creates a surface area that we can introduce a lot of really interesting things into. We haven't announced anything publicly associated with gen AI directly inside of Acrobat, but I think you can fairly safely expect to hear more about that from us soon. And what makes gen AI particularly interesting as it relates to Acrobat is the distribution that we have with Acrobat. So, if Acrobat is -- and Reader are in front of hundreds of millions of people on a monthly basis, our ability to insert generative AI into their workflows, just like we've been able to really differentiate our work on generative AI in creative by inserting it into the workflows of creative folks, I think that becomes the secret sauce to how we differentiate ourselves.\nKeith Bachman: Interesting. Thanks very much.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Brent Thill with Jefferies.\nBrent Thill: Shantanu, you mentioned success in ETLAs. What's driving that? Especially given some of the macro jitters are still lingering, are you starting to see those jitters go away and that's a result of what's happening with the ETLAs?\nShantanu Narayen: I think in the ETLAs specifically, Brent, both to the comments that David and Anil mentioned, the first is the amount of content that people are creating, there's a lot of interest associated with ensuring that the combination of Creative Cloud plus Express that people can really understand what they are spending on their content, as well as find ways to use AI to automate it, to localize it, to improve production costs. So, I think that message is certainly resonating with people. And the fact that Express can be a productivity application for every knowledge worker in the enterprise, much like Acrobat as well. So, I think both of those are really leading to a significant amount of great conversations. I think, mobile -- David perhaps mentioned even in his prepared remarks how mobile has been one of the tailwinds that we've seen, Brent. So, I think that's also working. So, I think investment in productivity gains is clearly top of mind right now. And both of these play well into that narrative in enterprises.\nBrent Thill: Thanks.\nOperator: And we have a question from Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research.\nAlex Zukin: Hey, guys, thanks for taking the question. And I guess a two-parter on generative AI. First just around the pricing model for generative credits, obviously, very progressive. And I guess how should we think about as we go forward? And you've seen at least on the hobbyist side, some of the usage of Firefly and within Express. How do we think about for the two cohorts of both obvious and professional creatives? How many credits are kind of a typical user or use case likely to drive in a given month? And to the question that you got kind of about Document Cloud and the impact of generative AI on that business, is it fair to think that given the pricing that's been announced, the next wave of incremental innovation, is that going to come more from a new product availability, or should we think about more pricing enabled levers to come?\nShantanu Narayen: I think, Alex, on the first question associated with how did we think about pricing, I mean, first, it's important to remember the breadth of all of the segments that we serve. In other words, how we think about K-12 all the way to the largest enterprise in the world. And I think it's fair to say that philosophically, we wanted to drive more adoption. And therefore, the pricing as it relates to what's included in the at least short run for Firefly subscriptions, Express subscriptions, GenStudio in terms of how much they can get within an enterprise is going to be the bulk of how we recognize the ARR. And I think getting that adoption and usage is where the primary focus is going to be in terms of the new user adoption, as well as for existing customers, the pricing upgrade. So that's how we think about it. We certainly need the ability to have the generative packs, but I think just getting everybody exposed to it. One of the real innovations that we did that's driven tremendous uptake in that is what we've called this context aware sort of menus within Photoshop. So, it's so front and center, you'll start to see that being rolled out in all of the other applications. So that's sort of the focus. Let's get the core subscriptions, let's get all of them exposed to it, and let's make sure that we're covering what we need to by the pricing actions that we took. So that was sort of the focus. I think on the Doc Cloud part and how we look at it, to add to again what David said, I mean, some of the things that people really want to know is how can I have a conversational interface with the PDF that I have? Not just the PDF that I have open right now, but the PDF that are all across my folder, then across my entire enterprise knowledge management system, and then across the entire universe. So, much like we're doing in creative, where you can start to upload your images to get -- you train your own models within an enterprise, [indiscernible]. The number of customers who want to talk to us now that we've sort of designed this to be commercially safe and say, hey, how do we create our own model? Whether you're a Coke or whether you're a Nike, think of them as having that, I think in the document space, the same interest will happen, which is we have all our knowledge within an enterprise associated with PDFs. Adobe helped me understand how your AI can start to deliver services like that. So, I think that's the way you should also look at the PDF opportunity that exists, just more people taking advantage of the trillions of PDFs that are out there in the world and being able to do things. The last thing maybe I'll mention on this front, Alex, is the APIs. So part of what we are also doing with PDFs is the fact that you can have all of this now accessible through APIs, it's not just the context of the PDF, the semantic understanding of that to do specific workflows. We're starting to enable all of that as well. So, hopefully that gives you some flavor. You're right, the generative credits has been designed to more for adoption right now, but we also wanted to make sure that at the high end, we were careful about how much generative credits we allow.\nDavid Wadhwani: Yeah. And just one thing to add to that, Alex, is that one of the things we did, first of all, it was a very thoughtful, deliberate decision to go with the Generative Credit model and the limits, as you can imagine, we're very, very considered in terms of how we set them. The limits are, of course fairly low for free users. The goal there is to give them a flavor of it and then help them convert. And for paid users, especially for people in our single apps and all apps planned, one of the things we really intended to do was try and drive real proliferation of the usage. We didn't want there to be generation anxiety put in that way. We wanted them to use the product. We wanted the Generative Fill and Generative Expand. We wanted the vector creation. We wanted to build the habits of using it. And then, what will happen over time as we introduce 3D, as we introduce video and design and vectors, and as we introduce these Acrobat capabilities that Shantanu was talking about, the generative credits that are used in any given month continues to go up because they're getting more value out of it. And so that's the key thing. We want people to just start using it very actively right now and build those habits.\nAlex Zukin: Super clear. Super thoughtful. If I could sneak one in for Dan. Of the $520 million in the net new ARR for Q4, just roughly, you've talked about before having some impact from the generative AI product that you were going to launch this year. Is it fair to assume it's very minimal in that $520 million?\nDan Durn: Yeah, I would say it's modest impact to the business in Q4. And again, a quarter from now when we give our FY 2024 targets, we'll have more to say of what that looks like going forward, but modest impact in Q4.\nAlex Zukin: Perfect. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: And we'll take a question from Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank.\nBrad Zelnick: Great, thanks very much. David, you talked about making Firefly APIs available to customers to embed Firefly into their own content creation and workflows. Can you talk about the use cases and monetization? And is this something you foresee partners leveraging as well into their own third-party offerings?\nDavid Wadhwani: Yes, absolutely. Our goal right now is for enterprises and third parties that we work with is to provide a few things. The first is this ability, obviously, to have API access to everything that we are building in, so that they can build it into their workflows and their automation stack. The second thing is to give them the ability to extend or train their own models as well. So, as we mentioned earlier, our core model -- foundation model is a very clean model that generates great content and you can rely on it commercially. We want our customers and partners to be able to extend that model with content that is relevant to them so that Firefly is able to generate content in their brand or in their style. So, we'll give them the ability to train their own model as well. And then, last but certainly not least, we'll give them some core workflows that will work with our existing products, whether it's Express or whether it's Creative Cloud or GenStudio as well, so that they can then integrate everything they're doing onto our core platform. And then, from a monetization perspective, you can imagine the metering concepts that we have for Generative Credits, extending to API calls as well. And of course, those will all be custom negotiated deals with partners and enterprises.\nBrad Zelnick: Great. Thanks very much for taking the questions. Congrats.\nJonathan Vaas: Hey, operator, we're getting close to the top of the hour. We'll take one more question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities.\nJay Vleeschhouwer: Great. Thank you very much. Shantanu, over the last decade or more, one of the most important attributes of how you've managed your product portfolio have been the intra-segment and inter-segment integrations, particularly between Digital Media and DX. There is, as you know, a famous acronym for that. Now when we think about the current generation of integrations that you just announced, including yesterday, aside from the Firefly-ing of the product line and the proliferation of Firefly, what are some of the internal developmental changes that you yourselves have had to make in order to support the development of new integrations, new packaging? What are you doing differently internally? And then, externally, particularly to support the new generation of products, what are you having to invest in, in terms of customer support and enabling their adoption?\nShantanu Narayen: Yeah, Jay, I mean, certainly I think at MAX also you'll see a bunch more of the innovation. I think first internally, I'd be remiss if I didn't start off by saying how really thrilled I am with how quickly the company has embraced the possibilities of AI, how we've run all of these betas out there at a scale that, as we have said, is unprecedented, dealing with the differentiation that we can provide, whether that's how we deal with the data, understanding the indemnification, how we embed all of this AI stuff in the interfaces, and we've already shown that in Photoshop, Illustrator, Express, as well as create the new offering. So, I think the pace of innovation internally of what we have done is actually truly amazing. I mean, relative to a lot of the companies that are out there and the fact that we've gone from talking about this to very, very quickly making it commercially available, I don't want to take for granted the amount of work that went into that. I think internally it is really galvanized, because we are our own biggest user of these technologies. What we are doing associated with the campaigns and the GenStudio that we are using, as David alluded to it, our Photoshop Everyone Can campaign, or the Acrobat's Got It campaign, or how we will be further delivering campaigns for Express as well as for Firefly, all of this is built on this technology. And we use Express every day, much like we use Acrobat every day. So, I think it's really enabled us to say, are we really embracing all of this technology within the company? And that's been a big change, because I think the creative products, we've certainly had phenomenal usage within the company, but the extent to which the 30,000 employees can now use our combined offering, that is very, very different internally. So, very pleased associated with that. And I think one way in which that manifests is that all of our product reviews right now include all three groups. So, there's very little product sort of reviews that happen without people from Creative and Document and the Experience Cloud being part of it. So that's one of them. I think the work that we have already put in on the digital excellence as part of D-DOM, that also gives us a lot of confidence of, \"Now that we have this breadth of offering, how do we make sure that we can personalize the offerings?\" Part of the success that was driven in this quarter, Jay, was to do with the fact that the Stock and these value-added services, I think the digital excellence team in terms of the D-DOM have really got very good at segmenting our customers and understanding how we can make sure that they have the right offering. And now think of that with all of the breadth of offerings that we have across mobile and desktop and web. So, I think internally and externally, this has been again a real sort of drinking from the fire hose of how we embrace AI. And so, I think those are really two examples of how we've done it. And the third thing I would say is that in parallel, internally we've had to really change. Where prior to this, Jay, we may have said, okay, we're really going to make all of this magic happen in one of our applications. Today, that has to happen not just within the application, which we've certainly done, but it has to happen as an API so that everybody else can use it. It has to happen as a web-only playground, which is what Firefly and Express both are. So, the simultaneous release of not just investing in the model, but making sure that's available across all the surfaces, I would say that's another thing. And the last thing I'll leave you with is you've seen this for imaging. Make no mistake, those same investments, whether it's in vector or animation or 3D or -- all of those video certainly are underway. And so, I think the parallelism associated with saying how do we embrace this opportunity, I think that's also been another big change. But I think it's clear given this was the last question before I hand it over to Jonathan that a lot of the questions have been focused on understanding right now all of our announcements and the monetization associated with it. But I did want to again sort of acknowledge that we have delivered all of this innovation at a breakthrough pace. And so, we'll certainly share more as it relates to how we see this play out. At MAX, you'll see us have more information on the products. And certainly with the 2024 targets, you'll start to get more visibility into how and why we believe this is both a growth opportunity as well as embracing new customers. So, thank you for joining us. And with that, I will turn it back over to Jonathan.\nJonathan Vaas: Thanks, Shantanu, and thanks everyone for joining us today. Looking ahead, we have an exciting lineup planned for MAX starting on October 10, and we hope you'll be able to attend the entire conference. At the Investor Meeting after the day one keynote, we plan to focus on the impact of AI across our customer offerings with previews into our technology roadmap and how these innovations expand Adobe's reach. Given that, fiscal 2024 targets will be provided at our December earnings call. In addition, we're planning another investor event at Adobe Summit in March to give more insight into our addressable markets and financial performance. We hope to see you there. Thanks, everyone, and this concludes the call.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. We do thank you for your participation.

You can find our press release as well as PDFs of our prepared remarks and financial results on Adobe's Investor Relations website. The information discussed on this call, including our financial targets and product plans, is as of today, June 15, and contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainty and assumptions. Actual results may differ materially from those set forth in these statements. For a discussion of these risks, you should review the factors discussed in today's press release and in Adobe's SEC filings. On this call, we will discuss GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Our reported results include GAAP growth rates as well as constant currency rates. During this presentation, Adobe's executives will refer to constant currency growth rates, unless otherwise stated. Reconciliations are available in our earnings release and on Adobe's Investor Relations website. I will now turn the call over to Shantanu.\nShantanu Narayen: Thanks, Jonathan. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Adobe had an outstanding quarter, achieving record revenue of $4.82 billion, representing 13% year-over-year growth. GAAP earnings per share for the quarter was $2.82, and non-GAAP earnings per share was $3.91. Our results demonstrate strong demand across Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and Experience Cloud with particular strength in Digital Media ARR. Adobe's mission to change the world through personalized digital experiences is more critical than ever as digital continues to rapidly transform work, life and play. Our groundbreaking innovations, including the new Adobe Express, the launch of Firefly, our family of creative generative AI models, co-pilot functionality in our creative applications, including Photoshop and Illustrator, AI-powered advancements in Acrobat; a new product analytics solution and the latest capabilities in real-time CDP are empowering an ever-expanding customer base to imagine, create and deliver standout content and experiences. We're executing against our strategy to unleash creativity for all, accelerate document productivity and power digital businesses. Every disruptive technology has presented exciting opportunities for Adobe to innovate and increase our addressable market opportunity. This has been true for cloud computing, mobile and AI. We have delivered hundreds of AI innovations through Adobe Sensei such as Neural Filters in Photoshop, Liquid Mode in Acrobat and Customer AI in Adobe Experience Platform. Our ongoing R&D investments have enabled a rapid development and deployment of Firefly, our generative AI technology. We believe generative AI will drive both further accessibility and adoption of our products. Our generative AI strategy focuses on data, models and interfaces. Our rich data sets across creativity, documents and customer experiences, enable us to train models on the highest quality assets. We will build foundation models in the categories where we have deep domain expertise, including imaging, vector, video, documents and marketing. We are bringing generative AI to life as a copilot across our incredible array of interfaces to deliver magic and productivity gains for a broader set of customers. Since its launch in March, Firefly has captured the imagination of the world with over 0.5 billion generations and we're just getting started. Our digital experience business is powering personalized customer engagement for companies around the world, enabling them to drive experience-led growth. We're delivering an innovative product road map and integrating Sensei gen AI services across Experience Cloud. Last week, we hosted a successful EMEA Summit with tremendous excitement from thousands of customers and partners reinforcing that digital is a critical imperative across industries. Adobe's category leadership and mission-critical products will continue to drive our growth. For FY '23, we now expect Creative Cloud and Document Cloud to end the year ahead of our previously issued revenue and ARR targets and Digital Experience to be slightly below our previous annual target given the current enterprise spend environment. As a result of our groundbreaking innovation and continued execution, we are pleased to raise total Adobe annual revenue and EPS targets. David, over to you.\nDavid Wadhwani: Thanks, Shantanu, and hello, everyone. Adobe has long had a mission to unleash creativity for all and today, this is more possible than ever through the power of AI. The introduction of the new Adobe Express and Firefly will go down as a seminal moment in our creative history. These innovative products and our generative AI copilot in our flagship applications will extend our leadership in core creative categories such as imaging, design, video, illustration, animation and 3D as well as attract an increasingly expansive global audience. In Q2, we achieved net new creative ARR of $354 million and revenue of $2.85 billion, which grew 14% year-over-year. We could not be more excited about our generative AI road map that will make Adobe products more accessible to an even larger universe of people, while dramatically enhancing productivity for existing customers. Firefly is attracting tremendous customer interest and is highly differentiated in the market. It is being directly integrated into our product workflows as a copilot to accelerate ideation, exploration and the end-to-end production process. Business and innovation highlights include the beta release of Firefly, Adobe's pioneering family of creative generative AI models and adobe.com/firefly, a destination that allows users to generate and refine content. Firefly's first model is trained on Adobe stock images and other openly licensed content designed to generate commercially viable, professional quality content. Firefly powered capabilities seamlessly integrated into Photoshop are catalyzing a new era of creative power and precision. The viral response to Photoshop's new generative fill copilot has been extraordinary across social media platforms. Users have now generated over 0.5 billion assets on the Firefly website and in Photoshop, making these 2 of our most successful beta releases in company history. Building on this innovation, earlier this week, we announced Generative Recolor in Illustrator, which will similarly serve as a generative AI copilot to millions of designers to iterate and transform Vector Art. We also released an all-new Adobe Express with Firefly generative AI capabilities that revolutionizes how everyone, from students to small business owners to marketers and large organizations, creates and share standout content. Adobe Express brings the magic of our technology from Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere and Acrobat to combine power and precision with speed and ease. The response to the public beta in particular the groundbreaking video editing capabilities has been overwhelmingly positive. The enterprise version of Adobe Express and Firefly will empower every employee in an organization to participate in the creation of content, campaigns and websites in conjunction with Experience Cloud. New AI-powered text-based editing and automatic tone mapping in Premier Pro makes video editors more productive. An expanded Frame.io platform that now supports collaboration across PDFs and images, in addition to video, increases the value of Adobe's Cross-Cloud content supply chain solution. A major Lightroom mobile update that instantly allows you to access photos from Apple iCloud and Android Gallery empowers our growing base of mobile-first and mobile-only users. Continued momentum with our ecosystem of strategic partners drives awareness of our products and top-of-funnel for Adobe. Google announced that Adobe Firefly will be a premier generative AI partner for Bard, powering text to image capabilities. NVIDIA and Adobe announced that we will collaborate on generative AI optimizations across hardware and software. Apple highlighted how Lightroom will empower users to edit photos on the Vision Pro VR headset at WWDC. Momentum across routes to market and customer segments, including key enterprise customer wins, EY, government of the Philippines, NVIDIA, Omnicom, TAFE, New South Wales and WPP. Our generative AI offerings represent additional customer value as well as multiple new monetization opportunities. First, Firefly will be available both as a standalone freemium offering for consumers as well as an enterprise offering announced last week. Second, copilot generative AI functionality within our flagship applications will drive higher ARPUs and retention. Third, subscription credit packs will be made available for customers who need to generate greater amounts of content. Fourth, we will offer developer communities access to Firefly APIs and allow enterprises the ability to create exclusive custom models with their proprietary content. And finally, the industry partnerships as well as Firefly represent exciting new top-of-funnel acquisition opportunities for Express, Creative Cloud and Document Cloud. Our priority for now is to get Firefly broadly adopted, and we will introduce specific pricing later this year. Now turning to the Document Cloud business. PDF has become the de facto standard for the world's unstructured data, and businesses of all sizes are turning to Adobe to help streamline and automate document-based workflows. Adobe Document Cloud offers a comprehensive set of ubiquitous products to accelerate document productivity across every device by seamlessly integrating PDF services into Acrobat. In Q2, we achieved Document Cloud revenue of $659 million, growing 14% year-over-year. We added $116 million of net new Document Cloud ARR with ending ARR growing 22% year-over-year. Business and innovation highlights include, significant growth in Acrobat web monthly active users, driven by searches for Acrobat verbs and further accelerated by an explosion of PDF consumption through our Chrome and Edge extensions; viral adoption of PDF collaboration services, which are both increasing active use among existing users and creating a growth loop to bring new users into the Acrobat ecosystem. Mobile momentum across both App Store downloads as well as documents consumed in liquid mode. New workflows between Acrobat and Express allow users to integrate documents seamlessly into their creative process. Express now has full fidelity PDF import and editing, which allows users to make documents visually stunning; momentum across routes to market and customer segments, including key enterprise customer wins, Boston Consulting Group, Cushman & Wakefield, Novartis, T-Mobile and WPP. Today marks the 30th anniversary of Acrobat, a significant milestone that is both inspiring and humbling. PDF and Acrobat are more relevant today than ever before. We are incredibly proud of how PDF continues to transform the world of digital documents, powering communication and productivity for billions of people every day and we know that the best is yet to come. The pending acquisition of Figma will further expand our addressable market, and we have been delighted to hear from customers, partners and industry analysts who are excited about the benefits that the combination will unlock. We continue to engage in conversations with the Competition and Markets Authority in the U.K., the European Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice as they conduct their regulatory reviews and given the merits of the case, we believe the transaction should close by the end of 2023. Adobe's Digital Media business is on a roll. We're rapidly delivering groundbreaking innovations across Creative Cloud and Document Cloud. Our increasing breadth of offerings is reaching a broader universe of customers, and our incredible go-to-market strength and proven data-driven operating model are propelling the growth of both our emerging and established businesses. Given the momentum, we are raising our net new Digital Media ARR and revenue targets for fiscal '23. I'll now pass it to Anil.\nAnil Chakravarthy: Thanks, David. Hello, everyone. In Q2, we continued to drive strong growth in our Experience Cloud business, achieving $1.22 billion in revenue. Subscription revenue was $1.07 billion, representing 14% year-over-year growth. Customer interest in the digital experience category remains high. Last week, we were excited to spend time with thousands of customers and partners at EMEA Summit. Businesses of all sizes and industries around the world are increasingly relying on digital channels to engage customers and deliver experience-led growth and they are turning to Adobe as their trusted partner on that journey. Adobe Experience Cloud offers the most comprehensive set of solutions for content and commerce, data insights and audiences, customer journeys and marketing workflows. Built natively on Adobe Experience platform, our real-time customer data platform provides businesses with a single view of their customers' data across every channel. Real-time CDP now delivers over 600 billion predictive insights each year, and customers are creating over 30 trillion audience segments every day. Experience Cloud is now used by 87% of Fortune 100 companies. For example, Prudential Financial uses our cross-cloud offerings to power its end-to-end customer experience management workflows from creating high-impact content with Creative Cloud and Express to delivering personalized customer experiences at scale with Adobe Experience Platform. In addition, Prada is using real-time CDP and Journey optimizer to connect digital and in-store customer experiences in real time while reimagining shopping experiences using Substance 3D. Our vision for Experience Cloud is to deliver personalized experiences at scale, and the power of generative AI accelerates our ability to do that.

These are just a few of the transformational innovations that Sensei gen AI is bringing to Experience Cloud. Business and innovation highlights include strong demand for Adobe Experience platform and native applications with our book of business now exceeding $500 million. This quarter, we unveiled new capabilities in real-time CDP that will enable brands to scale first-party data with look-alike audiences, significantly accelerating the delivery of personalized experiences. Realtime CDP is used by global brands across industries, including DICK'S Sporting Goods, General Motors, Henkel, Major League Baseball, ServiceNow and TSP Bank; the launch of Adobe Product Analytics, which combines customer journey insights with product analytics to drive a new level of product-led growth; a comprehensive content supply chain solution that connects content creation and delivery across Experience Cloud and Creative Cloud to help enterprises effectively manage their content demands. We're working with partners, including Accenture, IBM, Omnicom and Publicis to scale the delivery of content supply chain to our joint customers. Strong demand for Workfront as it rapidly becomes a solution of choice for teams to plan, orchestrate and launch personalized campaigns at scale. Global availability of Adobe Mix Modeler to provide marketers with an AI-powered, self-service solution to accurately measure campaigns across paid, owned and earned channels. New AI innovations in Adobe Experience Manager, that provide real-time content performance data and predictions on which content will perform best by audience segment. Leadership in industry analyst reports, including the IDC Marketscape for retail commerce platforms and a positive rating in Gartner's annual assessment of Adobe's enterprise strategy. Key customer wins, including DSV, ICICI Bank, JPMorgan, Kroger, Omnicom, Royal Canin, ServiceNow, T-Mobile and Volkswagen. While overall demand is strong and win rates remain healthy, as we enter the second half, we are seeing some projects being pushed out in the current enterprise spend environment, which we have reflected in our updated annual targets. In a world where digital has become the predominant channel to reach and engage customers, Adobe is uniquely positioned to keep winning with innovative products that power end-to-end customer experiences and enable enterprises to simultaneously drive growth and profitability. I'll now pass it to Dan.\nDan Durn: Thanks, Anil. Today, I'll start by summarizing Adobe's performance in Q2 fiscal 2023, highlighting growth drivers across our businesses, and I'll finish with financial targets. Adobe's Q2 results demonstrate strong demand across a diverse portfolio of products from individuals buying through digital channels to the world's largest enterprises. While we grow existing businesses and deliver world-class profitability, Adobe continues to incubate and invest in groundbreaking new technologies that will change how people work and democratize access to our tools. I couldn't be prouder of how Adobe has navigated the current environment and position the company to win. In Q2, Adobe achieved record revenue of $4.82 billion, which represents 10% year-over-year growth or 13% in constant currency. Business and financial highlights included, GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.82; and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.91, Digital Media revenue of $3.51 billion, net new Digital Media ARR of $470 million, Digital Experience revenue of $1.22 billion, cash flows from operations of $2.14 billion, RPO of $15.22 billion exiting the quarter; and repurchasing approximately 2.7 million shares of our stock during the quarter. In our Digital Media segment, we achieved Q2 revenue of $3.51 billion, which represents 10% year-over-year growth or 14% in constant currency. We exited the quarter with $14.14 billion of Digital Media ARR, growing 15% year-over-year in constant currency. We achieved Creative revenue of $2.85 billion, which represents 9% year-over-year growth or 14% in constant currency. We added $354 million of net new creative ARR in Q2, with strong digital demand for our offerings throughout the quarter. Second quarter creative growth drivers included, new user growth across geographies, customer segments and creative offerings driven by targeted campaigns and promotions and utilizing insights from our data-driven operating model, strong traffic and conversion on adobe.com, single app subscriptions, including a strong quarter for imaging driven by Everyone Can Photoshop campaign; strong growth in photography driven by accelerated demand for Lightroom mobile, another strong quarter for Adobe Stock and other emerging businesses with exiting ARR for both Frame.io; and Substance growing greater than 50% year-over-year in constant currency; continued success rolling out our new Acrobat CC offering integrated with Sign capabilities; and success in the enterprise as our creative and collaboration solutions continue to see strong adoption. Adobe achieved Document Cloud revenue of $659 million, which represents 11% year-over-year growth or 14% in constant currency. We added $116 million of net new Document Cloud ARR in the quarter, crossing the $2.5 billion milestone with exiting ARR growing 22% year-over-year in constant currency. Second quarter Document Cloud growth drivers included: strong subscription demand for Acrobat with integrated sign capabilities across customer segments and geographies, driven by targeted offers, DDOM Insights and our Acrobat's Got It campaign, success monetizing new customers through the Acrobat web funnel with monthly active users growing greater than 50% year-over-year as our product-led growth strategy continues to perform well, strength in Acrobat mobile downloads, conversion and engagement with liquid mode usage up over 40% year-over-year, and strength in the enterprise, driven by seat expansion. This quarter perpetual sales accounted for less than 5% of Document Cloud revenue. Turning to our Digital Experience segment. In Q2, we achieved revenue of $1.22 billion, which represents 12% year-over-year growth or 14% in constant currency. Q2 subscription revenue was $1.07 billion, which represents 11% year-over-year growth or 14% in constant currency. Second quarter digital experience growth drivers included: strong demand for our Adobe Experience platform and native applications, including real-time CDP, Customer Journey Analytics and Adobe Journey Optimizer. In Q2, subscription revenue for AEP and apps grew more than 60% year-over-year; strength in content and commerce with AEM as a cloud service, seeing significant book of business growth in Q2; customer interest in our content supply chain solution. The value proposition of seamlessly connecting content creation workflows to customer experience management is resonating with enterprises and is driving accelerated growth for Workfront and our content solutions, continued value realization from our solutions leading to strong retention across our customer segments, and momentum selling transformational deals to large enterprises, adopting our platform and end-to-end suite of applications, including T-Mobile and Omnicom. Adobe's effective tax rate in Q2 was 21.5% on a GAAP basis and 18.5% on a non-GAAP basis, in line with our expectations. RPO exiting the quarter was $15.22 billion, growing 10% year-over-year or 13% when adjusting for a 3% FX headwind. Our ending cash and short-term investment position exiting Q2 was $6.60 billion, and cash flows from operations in the quarter were $2.14 billion. In Q2, we entered into a $1 billion share repurchase agreement, and we currently have $4.15 billion remaining on our $15 billion authorization that was granted in December 2020 and goes through the end of fiscal 2024. In light of the momentum across our business and factoring in current macroeconomic conditions and summer seasonality, for Q3, we're targeting, total Adobe revenue of $4.83 billion to $4.87 billion, Digital Media net new ARR of approximately $410 million, Digital Media segment revenue of $3.55 billion to $3.57 billion, Digital Experience segment revenue of $1.21 billion to $1.23 billion, Digital Experience subscription revenue of $1.08 billion to $1.10 billion, tax rate of approximately 21.5% on a GAAP basis and 18.5% on a non-GAAP basis, GAAP earnings per share of $2.82 to $2.88 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.95 to $4. Given the company's performance in the first half of the year and our relentless focus on driving disciplined profitable growth, we're raising our annual fiscal 2023 targets for EPS and net new Digital Media ARR. We are also raising our total Adobe revenue target for fiscal 2023 with Digital Media ahead of our previously issued targets and Digital Experience slightly lower. For fiscal 2023, we're now targeting, total Adobe revenue of $19.25 billion to $19.35 billion, Digital Media net new ARR of approximately $1.75 billion, Digital Media segment revenue of $14.10 billion to $14.15 billion, Digital Experience segment revenue of $4.85 billion to $4.90 billion, Digital Experience subscription revenue of $4.30 billion to $4.35 billion, tax rate of approximately 21.5% on a GAAP basis and 18.5% on a non-GAAP basis, GAAP earnings per share of $11.15 to $11.25 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $15.65 to $15.75. In Q4, we expect to see year-end strength in customer demand for Digital Experience and Digital Media solutions. Our updated targets for fiscal 2023 demonstrates solid operating margin expansion in the second half as compared to the second half of fiscal 2022. In summary, I'm extremely pleased with Adobe's performance in the first half of the year. Few companies are capable of delivering strong top and bottom-line growth in a challenging environment, while at the same time, delivering game-changing innovations that will drive the next decade of growth. These innovations are generating strong customer demand for our products, shaping fiscal 2023 to be another wonderful year for Adobe. Shantanu, back to you.\nShantanu Narayen: Thanks, Dan. Our strong Q2 results underscore our momentum and the significant opportunities we have across our business. I'm proud of how our employees around the world continue to raise the bar, create the future and live our purpose. We continue to invest in hiring new college grads and interns to bring the best and brightest talent to Adobe. It's an incredibly exciting time at Adobe. Demand for our category-defining products and services continues to grow. Our innovation engine is delivering Adobe Magic for an expanding set of global customers and our strong execution is enabling us to address a massive market opportunity. 2023 is going to be another phenomenal year for Adobe as we continue to deliver top line growth and margins while investing in fundamental technologies that expand Adobe's success for decades. Thank you. We will now take questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo Securities.\nMichael Turrin: Nice job on the results. I mean, obviously, I think starting point is with Firefly. We've been fielding a number of questions just on how this alters the size of the market. You had some useful commentary both on monetization and your views on the market. But can you just add some context around early demand signals and how you're expecting this to show up both on the user side of the market and just the overall velocity of content generation? Thank you.\nDavid Wadhwani: Sure. Happy to talk about that. We're really excited, if you can't tell on the call, about the Firefly and what this represents. The early customer and community response has been absolutely exhilarating for all of us. You heard us talk about over 0.5 billion assets that have already been generated. Generations from Photoshop were 80x higher than we had originally projected going into the beta. And obviously, we feel really good about both the quality of the content being created and also the ability to scale the product to support that. And we have seen incredible social buzz. The Photoshop community is doing what it always does and is using the product, both Firefly and Photoshop, in ways that we didn't even think of when we were initially building the feature set. So it's great to see all this organic development and buzz coming up. And as we talked about, we're also excited about what this means from a business opportunity perspective. On the retention side, we think the value that we add in the flagship applications are going to be great for existing users. In terms of top of funnel, we think that this helps us reach billions of new users because it makes the act of creating more accessible with regard to conversion. We are very excited about what this can mean for new user onboarding, both Photoshop and Illustrator and also in Express that makes the onboarding of new customers especially early success far more achievable for them. It introduces new offers with adobe.com/firefly as a destination that we can monetize and everything that we talked about at Summit last week around what this can be as an enterprise-grade offering. And of course, with all of this, we have an opportunity to sell subscription credit packs for upsell opportunities. So if you net all that out, we see an ARPU opportunity. We see a net number of users opportunity, and also because of retention, an LTV opportunity. Now we expect all of this to play out over many years. We're very focused right now on user acquisition. None of this, we expect to impact our Q3 numbers. And we'll start to see some of it in Q4 but we don't expect it to be material. But as I mentioned, we expect to see it ramp over the next few years. And we'll share more specifics of this in the months ahead.\nMichael Turrin: Clearly lots to be excited about there. Thanks.\nOperator: And the next question will come from Saket Kalia with Barclays.\nSaket Kalia: Okay. Great. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question here. Congrats on a great quarter. David, maybe for you. I want to zero in on that point around Firefly and generating billions of potential users in the years ahead. Obviously, still very early with Firefly but as well as Adobe Express. But I'm curious, what are you seeing with Adobe Express and the ability for Firefly to generate some of that demand or pull through some of that demand for Express, both on the consumer side and the enterprise side.\nDavid Wadhwani: Yes. Very excited on both fronts. As you may have seen, we had a beta release of Express last week and this is a massive update to Express. In fact, it's a brand-new product effectively built from the ground up, and we believe this is the product for everyone to use. The response has been absolutely incredible. Broad-based feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, as you mentioned, because of the integration of Firefly, but also how Firefly is able to integrate directly into the user flows and the user journeys for utilization and generation of video content, also for PDF integrations so people are able to bring in and build end-to-end workflows to generate amazing marketing collateral with PDF. We've seen CC users, existing subscribers for CC very excited about the workflows that we've introduced with both Illustrator and Photoshop. Illustrator users are able to take their illustrator output, bring it into Express, add animation and push it out to social. Photoshop users are taking their corpus of Photoshop templates, and they're making that the foundation for easy editing and sharing for their marketing organizations. And that's really been sort of an incredible vote of confidence from everyone that we've seen using the beta, which has also driven the announcements we had last week, specifically around Express and Firefly package together for enterprises. And the interest that we've seen coming out of the announcement in terms of enterprise interest and pipeline generation associated with that has been terrific. And what we're particularly excited about that is it brings our clouds together. So Creative pros are able to create in Photoshop and Illustrator and our other flagship applications. Marketers are able to take that content and edit it more quickly in Express. Both of these are orchestrated through Workfront and Frame.io and they're pushed into AM. So really a core part of our content supply chain. It really feels like an inflection point for Express as well.\nShantanu Narayen: And Saket, maybe if I were to add two things to that. First, I think on the consumer side, with the new Express, if you can imagine it, you can do it. And so I think it's really powerful. And within an enterprise, much like Acrobat, we want every enterprise employee to now have a combination of both Acrobat and Express.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI.\nKirk Materne: Thanks very much and congrats on the quarter. I guess one, it's probably for David again. David, I was just kind of curious when you think about the enterprise part of the Visual Media business. How, I guess, prepared are customers from a content perspective and a data perspective to take on some of the generative AI capabilities that you guys are bringing to market? And I'm sure this blends into Anil, too, on the Adobe Experience Manager. But I was just wondering if you guys could talk about the data aspect of this and how that interplay might help, frankly, both sides of the Digital Media and the Digital Experience businesses. Thanks.\nDavid Wadhwani: Sure. I'll say a few words and then hand it off to Anil as well. So as we've talked about, Firefly, from the beginning, has a few core principles. The first is the quality of output, right? So text. We have capability of text imaging, text-to-text effect. We have vectors in there now. We're working on video design, 3D generation as well. So we have a series of all this incredible content that we think will be a cornerstone of everything needed for enterprise content velocity. The second thing is that we're building it in a way that we can integrate into existing workflows. We've already started to announce integrations into Photoshop and Illustrator and Express. You'll also start to see us continue those integration points, but you'll also start to see us integrate it more directly into the Digital Experience workflows as well. Third is that and perhaps most importantly, we've also been able to because of the way we share and are transparent about where we get our content, we can tell customers that their content generated with Firefly is commercially safe for use. Copyrights are not being violated. Diversity and inclusion is front and center. Harmful imagery is not being generated. So we're able to give them that confidence. And also, as part of our enterprise plans, give them indemnification for the content that's being created. So those things, I think, fundamentally help them engage that.\nAnil Chakravarthy: Just picking up on what you said. I think if you look at Express and Firefly and also the Sensei gen AI services that we announced for Digital Experience, comes at a time when marketing is going through a big shift from sort of mass marketing to personalized marketing at scale. And for the personalization at scale, everything has to be personalized, whether it's content or audiences, customer journeys. And that's the unique advantage we have. We have the data within the Adobe experience platform with the real-time customer profiles. We then have the models that we're working with like Firefly. And then we have the interfaces through the apps like Adobe Campaign, Adobe Experience Manager and so on. So we can put all of that together in a manner that's really consistent with the data governance that customers expect that their data is used only in their context and use that to do personalized marketing at scale. So it really fits very well together.\nShantanu Narayen: Maybe just given how much excitement we have around this, Kirk, three quick things. The first is it really allows for us to, within a company, have every marketer participate in the production and delivery of content. And so agility for an enterprise is great. Second thing maybe I'll add to what both Anil and David said. We can now create custom models. So think of it if you're a company like Coke or a company like Disney and you want to create these campaigns where you want to try out different things. The Firefly model can be customized for them. And that in conjunction with what we have with Express and AEM, really allows it to be tailored for that particular company. I also wanted to just clarify that, that entire go-to-market is completely aligned already within the company. And so we have one enterprise sales force calling on them across Express, Creative Cloud as well as Experience Cloud solutions.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is [indiscernible] on for Alex Zukin. Alex is flying right now, but he says it's good to see who the [indiscernible] winners are. So now to my question, the DM business continues to outperform in an impressive way. Can you talk to some of the underlying levers and stack rank what is driving the strength? Whether it's demand for content, uptake of newer products or cross-selling success? Can you help unpack the layers of success you're seeing? And then just on gen AI, you have announced new offerings with Generative Fill and more recently, Generative Recolor. As you are seeing kind of the traction you are getting online within the creative community, how is it helping inform you about where the greatest monetization opportunity is? Thank you.\nDavid Wadhwani: Sure. Yes, first of all, thanks for the question. Yes, we feel like we're off to a great start for the first half of the year. And as we look at it, the strength was very broad-based. Traffic to adobe.com and top of funnel was strong, frankly, all quarter long. And it's clear that our messaging is resonating well with a broader and broader set of audiences that we can reach. Second, we saw a strong conversion. Our product-led growth investments that we've been making for some time now are starting to pay dividends. Adobe.com is an area we've focused for a long time. We continue to see improvements in terms of customer journey work and conversion. And we've more recently been investing much more significantly in product-led growth motions in our core flagship applications like Photoshop and Acrobat as well. And we've been leveraging a lot of Anil's Digital Experience products that allow us to do personalization at scale in terms of in-product experiences there. And then lastly, it feels like we've really started to see some good inflection in our mobile applications, in particular, Acrobat on mobile and Lightroom mobile performed very well this quarter as well. In addition to that, as Dan mentioned in his opening comments, the emerging products like Substance and Frame continue to grow very nicely and really sort of slipstream into the content supply chain conversation that we're having with enterprise customers. And frankly, enterprise demand for content creation continues to grow. Anil said last week at EMEA Summit that our customers are expecting it to grow 5x in terms of content creation over the next few years. We continue to see more pull for creative apps. And also, we're starting to see enterprises invest much more in Acrobat penetration into their accounts. So they really want more people to have Acrobat from Adobe. So that's just to name a few things. Things are shaping up great for the year, and we're very excited about the direction of the business.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research.\nMark Moerdler: Thank you very much and congratulations on the strong quarter and the updated guidance. Dan, can you give us some color on how gen AI is going to impact margins? Especially 0.5 billion assets created just in the beta, the potential for substantial gen AI, once this is all launched, is going to be enormous. How should we think about that?\nDan Durn: Yes. Thanks for the question, Mark. As I reflect on the company's journey, we've got a long history of driving strong profitable growth. We deliver the innovation and the top line progression, but we do it in a very disciplined way, which drives margin and cash flow for investors. I see this playing out in a similar fashion. These are real investments. They are material investments we're making to unlock the magic of the Adobe technology platform and seamlessly integrating it across the product portfolio. When we think about the cost drivers, we think about training, we think about inference, we think about storage costs. The company is ruthlessly prioritizing how we're spending and what projects we're investing in to create a spend envelope to bring this technology to life in a very rapid fashion. You can see the discipline at play. We've been at this for several quarters. You see the strong print from a profitability standpoint in Q1. We followed through with a strong print again in Q2. And we look into the back part of the year, again, you're seeing second half year-over-year, second half over second half, showing an uptick from a profitability standpoint. So we're going to continue to stay focused on being very disciplined, how we prioritize what we do and don't do, and make sure we create the right kind of spend envelope for this technology as we bring it to life. I think it's an statement for us at the company and what we've done for a very long time here. Drive innovation, drive strong top line growth and do it in a very profitable way that's cash flow generative and value creative for investors.\nDavid Wadhwani: Yes. And just I'll add a little bit on to that because we've been working very closely between our engineering organization and the finance organization on a number of levers to make sure that we're managing and keeping discipline and cost front of mind. The first is the model training itself. There are a number of things the team has been doing to optimize our ability to train larger models more efficiently. The second is post training inference optimization. There's a lot of, I think, cutting-edge work coming out here, both in terms of research and the work we're doing around things like pruning and distillation and quantization that make the inference execution much more efficient. Third is, as we've talked about in the past, we're working with folks like NVIDIA to make sure that the hardware and software advances go hand in glove, and we're leveraging more and more compute pathways that are on the chip itself. Four is user experience, making sure that as we expose these things to users, we do it in a way that drives more efficiency in the back end. And of course, the big unlock longer term is about hybrid generative approaches. So how do we move more of this computing to the desktop as well, that will be a major cost benefit down the road. But it's a significant effort and a lot of work to do, and we take it very seriously.\nShantanu Narayen: And Mark, I just wanted to add, in addition to all of that great work that we're doing on saving costs, I'm more excited about the top line growth that this is going to cause for us.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Tyler Radke with Citibank.\nTyler Radke: Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about the Document Cloud strength you saw in the quarter. I saw that the business saw a nice improvement relative to last quarter. If you could just unpack that a bit. And then secondly, as I look at the full year outlook, clearly, a really strong quarter, one of the biggest speeds we've seen in years. As I think about Q4, just kind of the initial implied guide, is there anything to call out any one-time factors around pricing we should keep in mind as we compare the year-over-year decline or is that just conservatism?\nDavid Wadhwani: Yes. Maybe I'll talk about the Acrobat business and we can get to Q4 after that. So first of all, yes, another great quarter. It was great to see ARR growing 23%. And a lot of this is the basics of PDF demand, right? We've seen this incredible tailwind with demand for PDF continuing to grow. PDF has become the de facto standard for unstructured data. And PDF-related searches continue to grow. And this as Shantanu mentioned, and I mentioned in the prepared remarks, 30 years after PDF had launched. So it's amazing to see how things are going. We've been investing very heavily in expanding our top of funnel. We have Acrobat Web that's been driving a lot of new users. We've seen good growth directly to Acrobat Web. Acrobat Mobile has also been a source of new opportunity for us. We talked about our extensions in Chrome and Edge. And also we've mentioned in the past, our partnership with Microsoft to really make Acrobat the foundation or PDF and Reader, the foundation of all documents viewed in Edge as well. So that creates an enormous top of funnel for us, and we continue to sort of broaden that. In addition to that, we've been adding more value directly into the products with a proliferation of signatures and collaboration capabilities. And all of that, combined with our product-led growth motion, is driving strong conversion. So we feel really good about the foundation of that business.\nDan Durn: And coming to the guide, Tyler, the way I'd think about it is if we think about the journey to date this fiscal year, we had a strong print in Q1. We had a strong print in Q2. We've got a lot of momentum around this business. As we look into the back half of the year, we see that momentum continuing. We're 2 weeks into Q3. We see that momentum continuing. And as you would expect, we see a strong finish to the year in Q4. And we've got a long track record inside of the company of setting expectations and then executing against those expectations in a way that drives value for investors. And so I think the setup for the back half of the year is no different than that.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Matt Swanson with RBC.\nMatt Swanson: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. And I'll add my congratulations on the quarter. We've kind of talked from the beginning that a major differentiation point for Firefly is that this is an enterprise-safe generative model. Could you just give us some insights into your customer conversations and really how focused enterprises are around the potential, maybe a copyright or trademark issues that generative could create using other solutions.\nShantanu Narayen: Matt, maybe I'll take that. It's actually been off the chart the interest. We just had our Summit in London, following the successful launch that we had here where customers even in the U.S. were asking us questions. And I would say there are around three areas. All of them had perhaps experimented with other solutions. The moment Adobe came in and said this is both safe and designed for commercially safe as well as we can create the custom models, I think the interest associated with that has been off the charts. We've already created some custom models where we tweak our core model with assets that people can provide us. And that's also a secret sauce that we're unlocking and the integration of that within each of our products. So frankly, the product is not yet available, but the number of customers who want to sign on in terms of wanting to use it has been one of the most successful launches that we've had. And when I say the product is not ready, all I'm saying is it's not generally available. It's certainly available for them to put through their paces within the company.\nMatt Swanson: Yes. No, that sounds fantastic. We get the users and the CEOs to agree on the same product. That's a good combination.\nShantanu Narayen: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities.\nJay Vleeschhouwer: Thank you. Good evening. Shantanu, at Summit, with the content supply chain news, the company pretty much effectuated something that you've been talking about for the last number of years. That is content supply chain. And the question is about the potential business impact. Could you talk about what is fundamentally new or newly required in terms of pipeline development for that broader concept of implementing Adobe product? What you think the impact might be, for example, in your average book of business that you disclosed with your top 2,500 and top 1,000 customers each year at the analyst meeting? And you do seem to be investing still heavily in consulting capacity. So is that part of the development that you're foreseeing necessary for content supply chain?\nShantanu Narayen: A couple of points, Jay, and then certainly, Anil can add to it. First, I think, we are good user case for what's happening. The reality is that with what David talked about as it relates to product-led growth, what the content supply chain really allows us to do is start with a marketing brief that we're putting within workflow, start to create the campaigns, have AEM and our asset management solution be the place where all of these assets are and then deliver them through campaign as well as deliver them through the Adobe Experience Manager on the website. So I think the interest associated with this is all about trying to say all of the content that we are creating, how do we both make that more efficient as well as understand how we can both globalize, which has been a big driver of why people want this content supply chain. The traditional agencies, I think Anil referred to this. They all have not only, I think, procured our solution for their internal usage but they're also collectively taking this solution to joint customers. So I think it actually just really beautifully aligns within Anil's enterprise sales motion, how we can go with everything from workflow, which actually had a great quarter, so we continue to see good growth in workflow. So I think it aligns all of our offerings. And there isn't one customer that doesn't want. That's partly because of all the additional cost and scrutiny on what the expenses are right now.\nAnil Chakravarthy: Yes. We are just so uniquely differentiated across the Creative Cloud and Experience Cloud. And in terms of getting this implemented for customers, as you mentioned, we have now partnerships with Accenture, with IBM, with Omnicom, with Publicis. And all of them are working very closely with us, with our field teams to make sure that the content supply chain gets implemented for every customer across different verticals and geographies, specifically for their needs.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.\nElizabeth Porter: Great. Thank you very much. This is Elizabeth Porter on for Keith Weiss. Congrats on the strong quarter. And my question is again around generative AI. There's clearly a lot of investment and news across the industry. So are there generative AI capabilities that could become table stakes? And what are the areas that drive real differentiation that is monetizable for Adobe? How do you see this market evolving between those two pieces over time where Adobe really solidifies its leadership?\nShantanu Narayen: Yes. I think, for us, the entire generative AI really is all three layers that we talked about. And if you think about our generative AI strategy, it really first starts with do we have unique data that we can use on behalf of our customers for customers. And clearly, both in the creative in the document space with PDF as well as in the marketing space, the amount of data that we have is a key differentiator because that is going to dictate the models when you want to design this to be commercially safe. I think the second thing that we're really focused on is in the domains where we have incredible expertise, whether you consider it imaging or vector or documents or marketing, we are creating our own foundational models. And so when you create the foundation models, you really understand how that works, you understand how you can take it to an enterprise and create a custom model for that. But I think the real differentiator for Adobe continues to be, how does a user get value? And I think it's in the ubiquitous interfaces that we have, whether that's on the marketing side, everything where people are trying to create these campaigns or automate production or create a website or create a mobile app, similarly in documents, which we haven't touched on as much today, how they get the synthesis of the PDF, how they understand the structure of the PDF. And clearly, in creative that we've seen, both with Generative Recolor and Adobe Illustrator as well as Generative Fill in Photoshop. As long as we have the interfaces that delight customers and where all this magic comes to life, that's really, I would say, Adobe is differentiated. And you've seen that. It's not like there weren't other imaging models out there. The fact that we've captured the imagination of the community is a result of how all three of these layers really work well for Adobe better than anybody else.\nJonathan Vaas: Operator, we're right at the top of the hour. Let's take one more question and then we'll conclude.\nOperator: Thank you. And that question will come from Brent Thill with Jefferies.\nBrent Thill: Thanks. Shantanu, a lot of questions around why won't the DX Cloud give the Creative Cloud the [indiscernible] as well. Why are you confident this won't spill over? And given on the last question, I'll break the operator's policy and asking one for David on, when you think about just the number one question we're all getting, will AI reduce the number of seats available to you. Can you just address that? That's the number one question we continue to get. Thank you.\nDavid Wadhwani: Great. I'll start with the second, and we can go to the first after that. So Brent, if you take a look at Adobe's history, this is what we do, right? If you look at desktop publishing, if you look at creative imaging, if you look at video editing, the result of Adobe's focus here is always about increasing productivity, increasing the importance of these new workflows, and that has always led to an increase in jobs. Let's take video editing as an example, right? We lowered the cost of production in video significantly with our work with Premier and After Effects in Audition. And what that did was it increased the ability for people to create more content. So they didn't create the same amount of content with fewer people. What they did was they found new business opportunities. They created more niche content that led to video streaming and personalization, and that created an explosion in the industry around video production. That's what we do. And we're sitting at a moment where companies are telling us that there's a 5x increase in content production coming out in the next couple of years. And you see a host of new media types coming out. And we see the opportunity here for both seat expansion as a result of this. And also because of the value we're adding into our products themselves, increase in ARPU as well. Now beyond all of this, in terms of professional video and professional content creation, I should say, there's also a massive opportunity because this catalyzes our ability much more effectively to go after the billions of creators around the world who need things like this to be creative. So we're going to help them also create standout content. So again, I take a step back and I say, we have an opportunity to get more people into the franchise. We have the ability to drive more ARPU through our products. And we have the ability to make people more successful and drive more LTV. So the foundation, I think, is very strong.\nShantanu Narayen: And Brent, if I understood the question right, I mean, the interest within the DX customer base for what we are doing on Creative Cloud, if you look at both Summits, the interest associated with how these clouds and offerings are working together is actually one of the catalysts that I think will help both the Digital Media as well as the Digital Experience business. So you're right. I mean, we are finding that every customer is saying, this is the way for us to really go all the way from when we start to create a campaign all the way to the delivery and understanding the analytics associated with that. And I think the enterprise team has really aligned around this joint selling, and we've created a bill of materials where you can actually have both the Digital Experience as well as the Creative Cloud offerings in it. And I think that's what you're going to see. In the second half, we're going to have a lot more of these combined sales that happen with every enterprise because it helps, as we've been saying, with both the top line and the bottom line. And since it was the last question, I mean, let me end by saying it was a great first half. We appreciate all the comments that you have made about the quarter. And I wanted to thank the Adobe team for real great execution as well as, again, congratulate in particular, the Acrobat team for 30 years of amazing innovation. What I'm most proud of is, if you look at just the last few months in terms of what the company has delivered across Firefly and Generative Fill and Generative Recoloring, what's happening with Acrobat across the web, in Digital Experience, the Adobe mix model, product analytics, what we are doing around content supply chain, the new offerings that are coming for an increasing set of customers that will serve real customer problems I think really all goes well for how we will continue to drive innovation and serve customers as well. So I'm really excited about the second half as well as what we're going to continue to do in terms of delivering top line and bottom line growth. And with that, I'll hand it over to Jonathan.\nJonathan Vaas: Thanks, Shantanu, and thanks, everyone, for joining the call. I look forward to speaking with many of you soon, and this concludes the event.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today's conference.

I will now turn the call over to Shantanu.\nShantanu Narayen: Thanks, Jonathan. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Adobe had a strong Q1, driving record revenue across our Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and Experience Cloud businesses. We achieved $4.66 billion in revenue, representing 13% year-over-year growth. GAAP earnings per share for the quarter, was $2.71 and non-GAAP earnings per share was $3.80. Digital is reshaping how we connect and engage with the world around us. Our performance demonstrates the critical role that Adobe products are playing in fueling the global digital economy, empowering everyone everywhere to imagine, create and bring any digital experience to life. We are executing against our strategy to unleash creativity for all, accelerate document productivity and power digital businesses, delivering on our innovative product roadmap and engaging a growing universe of customers from individuals to small businesses to the largest enterprises. Given the recent news reports, I wanted to provide an update on the process and timing of our pending acquisition of Figma. We remain excited about the opportunity to advance product design, accelerate collaborative creativity on the web, and redefine the future of creativity and productivity. The potential combination continues to be well received by customers, industry analysts and partners. In addition, we are preparing for integration as we work through the regulatory process. From the outset, we have been well prepared for all potential scenarios while realistic about the regulatory environment. We have completed the discovery phase of the U.S. DOJ second request and are prepared for next steps, whether that is an approval or a challenge. Adobe remains confident in the facts underlying the case. And based on current process timing, we believe the transaction continues to be on track for a close by the end of 2023. It goes without saying that our Q1 success demonstrates that we continue to be ruthlessly focused on executing against our immense opportunities, independent of this combination. David, over to you.\nDan Durn: Thanks, Shantanu. Hello, everyone. We are living in a visual digital-first world where content creation and consumption are exploding and where consumers, students and businesses need to create content that stands out and elevates their online profiles. As a result, more and more people are turning to Creative Cloud, which remains a preeminent destination for creativity across imaging, design, video, illustration and animation as well as new media types like 3D and augmented reality. We continue to see strong demand for our flagship applications, including Photoshop, Lightroom, Illustrator, Premiere Pro and Acrobat and are excited about the traction we are getting with Adobe Express. Q1 was a strong quarter for Creative Cloud. We achieved net new Creative ARR of $307 million and revenue of $2.76 billion, which grew 13% year-over-year. Q1 highlights include strong growth in top-of-funnel traffic, which resulted in healthy new demand for creative cloud applications across all routes to market and customer segments globally from individuals to SMBs, to large enterprises, increased demand and mobile adoption in imaging with products like Photoshop and Lightroom. Lightroom Mobile is now the default photo editor for the high-end photo editing experience on the Samsung Galaxy S-23 Series, continued momentum for Premier Pro, After Effects and Frame.io, which are leaders in video editing and collaboration. Over two-thirds of films at Sundance as well as Oscar winners, Everything Everywhere All At Once and Navalny were edited with our video products. Rapid adoption of Substance 3D by brands such as Amazon, Burberry and Louis Vuitton, the Substance 3D team was honored with a technical Oscar in recognition of 3D capabilities that are making popular films such as Spider-Man, Star Wars and Blade Runner 2049 possible. Acceleration in our Adobe Stock business driven by the demand for high-quality imaging vector, video and 3D content. Momentum for Adobe Express with significant year-over-year growth in monthly active users across segments such as students, small businesses and creative professionals. We are actively driving adoption of both new users and existing Creative Cloud subscribers who are now using Express when they want speed and ease and we look forward to an imminent release of a dramatic upgrade with enhanced performance, collaboration functionality and new authoring capabilities for video and mixed media. Exciting introduction of new products, including our beta releases of Character Animator and Adobe Podcast. Adobe Podcast is a web-based AI-powered audio recording and editing app, perfect for the growing podcast industry. It makes every recording even those done on your phone in busy spaces, sound like they were recorded in a studio. Key customer wins in the quarter include Accenture, BBC, Disney, IBM, Infosys and Nintendo. Our innovation engine continues to fire on all cylinders to reimagine the future of creativity. Last October, we previewed some of Adobe\u2019s generative AI technology at MAX. We have been hard at work training Adobe models on our proprietary data sets, creating APIs, envisioning new services and integrating all these capabilities into our existing applications as a creative co-pilot. These innovations are developed and deployed in alignment with Adobe\u2019s AI ethics principles of accountability, responsibility and transparency. Stay tuned for some exciting announcements slated for next week in conjunction with Adobe Summit. Digital documents are powering productivity at home and at work, whether users are filing a tax form, submitting a sales contract, requesting feedback on a marketing campaign or completing an online bank transaction. Adobe Document Cloud is a leader in digital documents, redefining how people view, edit, share, scan and sign documents across desktop, web and mobile. In Q1, Document Cloud had record revenue of $634 million, which represents 16% year-over-year growth and strong net new ARR of $103 million, with ending ARR growing 22% year-over-year in constant currency. Q1 highlights include continued demand for PDF with outstanding growth in documents opened in the Acrobat Chrome extension and the new integration that will make Acrobat Reader the default PDF viewer in Microsoft Edge for over 1 billion Windows users; significant growth in monthly active users for Acrobat web, driven by search volume for PDF related verbs and a continually optimized funnel to our web offering; continued proliferation of Acrobat driven by demand for integrated functionality such as Share for Review for collaboration and Adobe Sign for e-signatures; outstanding increase in API transactions as our ecosystem and business customers continue to customize and integrate document services; strong demand across all routes to market and customer segments globally from individuals to SMBs to large enterprises. Key customer wins include Bank of Montreal, HP, JPMorgan Chase, Ministry of Defense of Netherlands, Samsung and Verizon. Given the strong Q1, the demand for our products and our innovation roadmap, we are pleased to raise our FY \u201823 Digital Media net new ARR target. I will now pass it to Anil.\nAnil Chakravarthy: Thanks, David. Hello everyone.

I will now pass it to Dan.\nDan Durn: Thanks, Anil. Today, I\u2019ll start by summarizing Adobe\u2019s performance in Q1 fiscal 2023, highlighting growth drivers across our businesses, and I\u2019ll finish with financial targets. Q1 was a strong start to the year for Adobe. I know the macroeconomy is on every investor\u2019s mind right now, and you can see the resilience and diversification of Adobe\u2019s business in our financial results. Businesses today are prioritizing investments in order to maximize returns and impact, both to drive their top line and to deliver operational efficiency. And individuals are looking to create content that enables them to connect and stand out across digital platforms. In this environment, the demand for our products continues to be strong as our solutions are mission-critical to customers in a world where digital content and engagement drive the global economy. Our product differentiation, engine of innovation and data-driven operating model are continuing to drive Adobe\u2019s growth. We have a world-class balance sheet, industry-leading margins, a strong cash flow profile and a proven track record. I can\u2019t think of a company that\u2019s better positioned as we continue to innovate in our core business and create and scale emerging businesses to drive profitable growth. In Q1, Adobe achieved record revenue of $4.66 billion, which represents 9% year-over-year growth or 13% in constant currency. Business and financial highlights included: GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.71 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.80, Digital Media revenue of $3.40 billion, net new Digital Media ARR of $410 million, Digital Experience revenue of $1.18 billion, cash flows from operations of $1.69 billion, RPO of $15.21 billion exiting the quarter and repurchasing approximately 5 million shares of our stock during the quarter. In our Digital Media segment, we achieved Q1 revenue of $3.40 billion, which represents 9% year-over-year growth or 14% in constant currency. We exited the quarter with $13.67 billion of Digital Media ARR. We achieved Creative revenue of $2.76 billion, which represents 8% year-over-year growth or 13% in constant currency, and we added $307 million of net new creative ARR in the quarter. Q1 Creative growth drivers included new user growth, fueled by customer demand and targeted marketing campaigns, which drove increased web traffic in the quarter; adoption of our Creative Cloud All Apps offerings across customer segments and geographies; students graduating from our Education segment into the creative professional job market; continued strength in upselling our new Acrobat CC offering, which includes integrated sign capabilities; licensing of individual applications, including a strong quarter for our imaging and photography offerings; momentum in high-growth businesses, such as Substance and Stock, where we had a tremendous quarter generating new business; and with Frame, which we are successfully cross-selling into our video customer base; a fast start to the year selling into our large enterprise accounts. Adobe achieved Document Cloud revenue of $634 million, which represents 13% year-over-year growth or 16% in constant currency. We added $103 million of net new Document Cloud ARR in the quarter. Q1 Document Cloud growth drivers included continued growth of Acrobat web, demonstrating the success of our product-led growth strategy; strength in conversion and retention rates of our Acrobat mobile customers; demand for Acrobat subscriptions across all customer segments; success generating new customer demand for Acrobat Sign in SMB and the mid-market; and strength in the enterprise, driving seat expansion for our Acrobat business. Turning to our Digital Experience segment. In Q1, we achieved revenue of $1.18 billion and subscription revenue of $1.04 billion, which represents 12% year-over-year growth or 14% in constant currency. Q1 Digital Experience growth drivers included success closing numerous transformational deals with large enterprises that are choosing Adobe to be their end-to-end CXM platform to drive personalization at scale; momentum with our AEP and native applications with the book of business growing more than 50% year-over-year; strength with our Content and Workfront solutions as our content supply chain strategy is resonating with customers; renewal rates of our enterprise customers that continue to be strong; and sales execution across multiple geographies. Turning to the income statement and balance sheet. In Q1, we continued with our strategy of making disciplined investments to drive growth while identifying cost-saving opportunities to drive earnings. Adobe\u2019s effective tax rate in Q1 was 22% on a GAAP basis and 18.5% on a non-GAAP basis, in line with our expectations. For fiscal 2023, Adobe\u2019s management is adopting a fixed long-term projected non-GAAP tax rate to assess and report on operating results, which we believe provides a clear view of Adobe\u2019s financial performance. The fixed long-term non-GAAP rate considers our current operating structure, existing tax positions, legislation and available forecast information. This rate is based on a 3-year projection and may be adjusted for changes in the future. RPO exiting the quarter was $15.21 billion, growing 10% year-over-year or 13% when factoring in a 3 percentage point FX headwind. Our ending cash and short-term investment position exiting Q1 was $5.65 billion and cash flows from operations in the quarter were $1.69 billion. Over the past year, we completed a thorough review of our short-term investments and marketable securities to ensure we are prepared for the current environment and with a bias towards the higher end of the investment-grade spectrum. Adobe does not hold substantial assets or securities at Silicon Valley Bank or any regional bank. In Q1, we entered into a $1.4 billion share repurchase agreement, and we currently have $5.2 billion remaining of our $15 billion authorization granted in December 2020, which goes through the end of fiscal 2024. In light of the strong start to the year and momentum across our business and factoring in the macroeconomic environment, for Q2, we\u2019re targeting: total Adobe revenue of $4.75 billion to $4.78 billion, Digital Media net new ARR of approximately $420 million, Digital Media segment revenue of $3.45 billion to $3.47 billion, Digital Experience segment revenue of $1.21 billion to $1.23 billion, Digital Experience subscription revenue of $1.06 billion to $1.08 billion, tax rate of approximately 21.5% on a GAAP basis and 18.5% on a non-GAAP basis, GAAP earnings per share of $2.65 to $2.70 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.75 to $3.80 and. As a result of the strong performance in Q1 and trajectory of the business, we are raising our fiscal 2023 net new ARR and EPS targets. For fiscal 2023, we are now targeting Digital Media net new ARR of approximately $1.70 billion, GAAP earnings per share of $10.85 to $11.15 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $15.30 to $15.60. In summary, I\u2019m pleased with our strong top line and bottom line execution in Q1, demonstrating the momentum we\u2019ve established for the year. Our strong engine of innovation, combined with our operational rigor, are driving profitable growth and position us well to capture the massive growth opportunities at our doorstep. Shantanu, back to you.\nShantanu Narayen: Thanks, Dan. Adobe\u2019s Q1 results underscore our strong momentum and the significant opportunities we have across our businesses. We\u2019re thrilled to be back in Las Vegas for Adobe Summit next week. In addition to unveiling several new innovations across Experience Cloud, Creative Cloud and Document Cloud, we will share how we are building on our decades of AI leadership to deliver generative AI technologies that redefine creativity and customer experiences. We look forward to seeing you there. Adobe\u2019s employees around the world motivate us to continuously raise the bar and create the future. This quarter, we were named to Glassdoor\u2019s Best Places to Work; Bloomberg\u2019s Gender Equality Index for the 5th year in a row; and the CDP A List, which recognizes leadership and environmental impact. Our renowned brand, mission-critical products, and vast base of customers create an unmatched advantage that will fuel our growth. Thank you, and we will now take questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from the line of Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nBrad Zelnick: Great. Thank you so much for taking the question. And congrats on a really strong start to the year. Dan, your guidance explicitly embeds assumptions for the macro environment. Can you share with us what those are and how those assumptions might have changed from a few months ago when you last guided? Thanks.\nDan Durn: Yes. Thanks, Brad. There is really no change in our view in the macro environment. I think we\u2019re pretty clear at the time we set our annual guidance, the environment that we\u2019re in. We see the environment that others see. I think you can see that the company is performing really well against that backdrop. So we feel good about how we\u2019re situated, the way in which we\u2019re engaging with customers and its broad diversified performance across that environment. And so we like how we\u2019re set up, but there is really no change to the assumptions underlying the macro environment. We see the same environment that others do.\nBrad Zelnick: Thank you.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from the line of Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nAlex Zukin: Yes. Hi, guys. So maybe just what do you think is the driving force behind \u2013 so many companies are talking about longer sales cycles, difficult to closing business. You had an outstanding quarter, specifically within the enterprise. So maybe what\u2019s driving those macro headwinds for others that you\u2019re not seeing or your resiliency specifically? And then on the topic of metrics, every metric was strong as we looked at revenues, RPO, Digital Media ARR operating margins. But maybe just can you talk about deferred revenue in the quarter? Anything there that was a headwind, because it did look like free cash flow was a little bit lighter than what we were expecting?\nShantanu Narayen: I\u2019ll take the first, Alex, and then maybe Dan can speak to the second. I mean, I think, as Dan said, when we look at the macroeconomic situation, and you can see strong companies actually refer to this across the board, whether it\u2019s consumers, whether it\u2019s small and medium businesses, whether it\u2019s enterprises globally, I think the reality is that digital for them is an imperative. And really for companies that have innovative solutions, it\u2019s a tailwind. I think what a lot of companies are focused on is the message that enterprises are certainly sharing is that if the prior focus was growth at any cost, certainly, they are looking for more profitable growth. And I think if you look at our solutions on the creative document or enterprise side, we help them. We help them with growth, but we help them with profitable growth and engaging with customers. The second thing I would say is that there is a large TAM here, and so I think our job in this environment is making sure that we have an even larger pipeline that we go address and attract because there may be some difference in the closure rates. But I think if you look at it in aggregate, our job is looking at it and saying how do we differentiate ourselves. I think the one thing also I would say, Alex, is that a lot of the companies that have single product offerings, I think they are probably seeing more headwind because a certain company may not put one part of what they offer as a priority. And I think a lot of the companies are looking at it and saying if we\u2019re engaging in digital, we might change our focus from content management to the implementation of the customer data platform or there might be a focus more on campaigns or ensuring that the advertising spend, the attribution associated with it. So I think the team has executed against continuing to try and drive a large opportunity. The other thing I think we feel good about is the fact that both Summit as well as in the U.S. and UK, we\u2019re looking forward to being in person because we can engage more in person with them. So hopefully, that gives you some color of why perhaps the stronger companies are showing more macro strength than other companies.\nDan Durn: And Alex, I\u2019ll jump in on the second part of the question. As we think about RPO being up 13% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, you think about the underlying performance of deferred revenue, unbilled backlog, it\u2019s very similar profile across both of those dimensions of the RPO. If you think about cash flow, the one thing I would point to, we all know that there has been a change in the tax regulation around capitalization of R&D expenses. We signaled at the time we set our annual targets that we would see a step-up in cash taxes starting this quarter, and that\u2019s really what you see profiling through operating cash.\nAlex Zukin: Prefect. Thank you, guys. Congrats.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We will take our next question from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nKeith Weiss: Hi, excellent. Thank you, guys for taking the question. A really nice quarter. I think my question is actually a deep dive into the prior two questions. Dan, maybe digging a little bit into sort of what Brad was asking. We are like, from a market perspective and an investor perspective, worrying about these kind of incremental impacts like Silicon Valley Bank and other bank failures. And you\u2019re seeing continued like a reduction in headcount from big shops like Meta on a go-forward basis. So I think the market is getting incrementally worried about the underlying kind of macro impacts. But you guys went the other way. Like in Q1, you\u2019re taking up your net new ARR additions for Digital Media. So can you walk us through specifically, is there anything mechanical or sort of tactical, if you will, that gives you guys the confidence that like even with the heightened kind of volatility that we\u2019re seeing out there that you guys feel comfortable in Q1 taking up that full year guide? And then on the other side of the equation on the free cash flow, can you just specify for us and you can give us a sense of kind of where those cash taxes are going to go over time just to help us kind of tune in our model?\nDan Durn: Yes. So let me take them in reverse order. In terms of cash taxes, there is a 5-year amortization period around the capitalization of that R&D. So you\u2019ll see a pretty dramatic cash tax step-up initially. But over that 5-year amortization period, it will converge on the reported tax rate. And so that\u2019s the general profile, and that\u2019s why you see the significant step-up in Q1 just starting that process now. In terms of the environment we are in, clearly, the company is performing well. You see the diversification of our business that\u2019s across geographies, industry sectors, product portfolio. The company is just performing well at a broad base way on the strength of that performance and the momentum we have, the visibility we have into the full year. We think it\u2019s the prudent thing to set expectations with investors in a way that reflects what we see as the opportunity in the company-specific performance. When I take a step back and I think about what is driving that differential performance in this environment, I think our products are mission-critical to our customers. We are on the critical path of them generating revenue. But as the world goes digital and those investments are prioritized, not only do we help companies drive top line growth, but we help them with the underlying productivity gains that go with that. It is why customers in this environment are prioritizing around things that we sell to enable their success. It addresses top line performance as well as underlying profitability of our customers. So being on the critical path, being mission critical to customers, we think this is the type of environment where the power of Adobe and the performance of the company gets to shine.\nDavid Wadhwani: Yes. And I\u2019ll just add a little bit specific to Digital Media. The foundation of the growth that we have, we still feel a very significant tailwind even in this market. Shantanu talked about the strength of the enterprise business. Every business needs to be a digital business. Digital content is fueling the global economy. That\u2019s true for smaller organizations and individuals as well. If you look at the creator economy, we\u2019re seeing more people come in to start to create their own personal online brands. So we saw a very strong digital funnel. As well, we had the highest traffic that we\u2019ve ever had come to adobe.com. And even in small, medium businesses, the part of their business that they need to invest most in is the digital channel as Dan was talking about. You look at that diversity, you then layer on the diversity of the growth drivers that we have in the business, whether it\u2019s new user acquisition, whether it\u2019s upsell of existing users, whether it\u2019s retention rates, whether it\u2019s new businesses like Substance or Stock or the pricing and packaging opportunities that we have. Every one of those levers has been very productive for us. In terms of primary growth driver, it is and always has been new user acquisition. It is by far the biggest contributor, and a lot of the PLG work that we\u2019ve done over the last year or 1.5 years is contributing to not just top of funnel, but also conversion of that top of funnel. In terms of upsell and migration, we\u2019ve been investing for a decade or more in education, and we have a very efficient channel now where students that graduate effectively upgrade and migrate into full priced offerings. That drove a very strong Creative Cloud individual all apps quarter for us. Retention, we\u2019ve been doing a lot of work in retention through PLG, but we\u2019ve also been driving a lot of utilization of Adobe Express as part of the Creative Cloud business. All of that combined makes for a very strong retention rate. New businesses, we talked about Substance and Frame having outsized growth. And of course, the pricing and packaging work that we\u2019ve been doing and all along continues to contribute to that, both for CC and Acrobat CCDC as a whole. So looking ahead, all of these drivers and these levers are intact, and we have lots of opportunities going forward as well.\nShantanu Narayen: And maybe just putting it altogether if you look at it and say that, hey, we did $410 million in Q1, we are targeting $420 million of net new ARR in Q2. The question you would have asked us if we hadn\u2019t done this was what are you signaling about the second half of the year. So I think it\u2019s a way of showing that the momentum is there in the business.\nKeith Weiss: Super helpful. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from the line of Jake Roberge with William Blair. Please proceed.\nJake Roberge: Hey, congrats on great results. I just want to double click on that retention commentary you said, you called out several \u2013 in several areas of the business during the prepared remarks. Is there anything specific that you\u2019re doing differently in this period of macro uncertainty that\u2019s driving those results? And have you started to see Express help at all with retention metrics as customers now the tier that they can actually graduate down to?\nShantanu Narayen: Well, for a couple of years right now, we\u2019ve been really focused on what we\u2019ve called in the past, the data-driven operating model and really being pretty focused on driving the business both with the narrative and the number. And so I think as we continue to, as David mentioned, have different products. And he is really focused on how we are acquiring them, how are we engaging them, what\u2019s the usage, how do we make sure they are getting value for the product, how do we continuously tell them about what\u2019s new. And then I think as David has come in and introduced the notion of product PLG, I think that part has also really started to reflect in making sure that customers know that we\u2019re building products and features that are relevant for the pain points that they have. So I would say the underlying business, while they are sort of the digital imperative, I wouldn\u2019t underestimate the incredible execution that the team continues to do on that or in DX. I mean how do you look at the solutions we\u2019re selling? How do you understand cross-sell? How do you understand upsell? And I think the hours and hours of work that goes in is sometimes not appreciated, but I\u2019m incredibly respectful and appreciative of what the teams have done. So a lot of execution is, I think, the short answer.\nJake Roberge: Great. Thanks for taking my questions.\nOperator: And we will take the next question from the line of Brad Sills with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nBrad Sills: Great. Thank you so much. I wanted to ask about that top of funnel activity that you have been generating here with Communicator and the consumer segment with Creative Cloud Express, the success you\u2019re seeing there, some exciting new announcements coming here. It sounds like on Creative Cloud Express enhancements here. Could we interpret that to mean that perhaps you\u2019re pivoting more towards upselling those customers to some of these newer features and offerings that are coming with Creative Cloud Express away from that top of funnel activity that you\u2019ve been very successful with thus far? Thank you.\nDavid Wadhwani: Yes. As Shantanu talked about, it\u2019s a holistic process. First of all, we\u2019ve, over the last couple of years, spent a lot of time with product-led growth. What that gives us is confidence that when people come to Adobe.com and they get into the products, they are going to have a great onboarding experience. They are more likely to convert, and they are more likely to stay, which then starts to give us more confidence and growth in terms of improving what has already been a world class in terms of lifetime value. As that happens, we\u2019ve been running more targeted campaigns with things for Photoshop and Acrobat and Illustrator as an example that are more targeted to the growth activities and the landing pages in the products themselves. And we\u2019ve actually been connecting all of our outbound marketing activities with landing pages in the products themselves. So we have been able to really increase our demand efforts and the ROI associated with that to bring more traffic to top of funnel. In addition to that, we have been investing a lot in growth loops. So people are able to now when using the products actually share some of \u2013 share the content out to stakeholders. Those stakeholders are able to look at that content, but also become top of funnel opportunity for us. If you look at Acrobat Web, as an example, we have seen a massive increase in terms of Acrobat Web usage driven by things like Share for Review. So, that drives more top of funnel for us. And then third is partnerships. We have been working very closely with Microsoft as an example. We have announced that Reader, as an example, will be the default PDF viewer in Edge, which now gives us access to over billion users on Windows-based devices. So, it\u2019s a cacophony of these activities that ultimately results in strong top of funnel. And then as we talked about, it\u2019s really about the hard work and the data to drive personalized experiences at scale, leveraging a lot of Anil\u2019s DX businesses and products to drive users all the way through to conversion.\nBrad Sills: Wonderful to hear. Thank you.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from the line of Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.\nMichael Turrin: Hey. Great. Thanks. Thanks for taking the question. One of the things that stood out is you mentioned wins over single product competitors and a few key areas on the digital experience side. Can we go a bit deeper into that as this environment and some of what\u2019s happening on the private company side, maybe presenting opportunities you are now able to take advantage of? I would just be curious here a bit more on maybe both the DX and DM side, just what\u2019s happening there. Thank you.\nAnil Chakravarthy: Yes. Let me start on the digital experience side. We have a broad and comprehensive portfolio, and it\u2019s integrated with the Adobe Experience Platform. So, from a customer perspective, they get the best of both worlds. They get those best-in-class applications, whether it\u2019s content and commerce or customer journeys or data insights or workflow, marketing workflow, and they get the benefit of integration with the Adobe Experience Platform and the native apps that we have built there. So, that\u2019s a powerful combination. It helps to really address what Shantanu was talking about, which is how do you keep growing through your digital channels and you get the revenue growth, but you also get the benefit of getting efficiency through consolidation. And that\u2019s where we believe we really shine as customers are looking at their overall stack, similar to what they have done in other aspects of their IT enterprise architecture. They are looking at who is my go-to platform that I can really standardize on and I will build around, and so we are getting the benefit of that choice.\nDavid Wadhwani: And on the DME side, we look at the \u2013 just like all the energy in the market around single product players, whether it\u2019s a mobile app, whether it\u2019s a web app or whether it\u2019s this excitement, incredible excitement and that we have as well around generative AI really is focused on driving top of funnel because it\u2019s driving a lot of awareness of creativity and the things that people want to do. And ultimately, as they leverage those apps, as they see themselves as more accretive, they inevitably end up at our doorstep going forward.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from the line of Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nKash Rangan: Thank you very much. I just want to pick up there. I think David talked about the excitement with generative AI, anybody that wants to jump in. What does this mean for Adobe? Is this just somewhat substitutive for all the opportunity that you have, or is it somewhat incremental or massively incremental? And how does Adobe monetize generative AI? Is this something that you can create a separate SKU or charge more? I am curious to get your thoughts quantitatively and qualitatively. Thank you so much.\nDavid Wadhwani: Kash, I think there was about three or four questions, but all related. So, happy to take those really quickly. Nicely played. First of all, this is really about increasing the total number of users, we believe, very strongly. As we talked about at MAX, this is about enhancing human creativity, not replacing it. And ultimately, whether you are an individual solo printer SMB or enterprise, we are hearing the same thing, which is that you need to create more content than you are able to create today. And so this really plays well into our core strengths. As you know, we have got a decades-long focus on AI, things like neural filters and object selection. And hundreds of other features have been based on AI for us, and they have increased creativity, and they have increased productivity, and they have helped people keep up with the demand for content. They have also made it easier for people to onboard into the experiences, and so we have been able to broaden the opportunity for people to start leveraging and using our core products. We have now been able to leverage the hundreds of people that are in our research organization and really target them towards generative technology, which we believe is a huge step forward, leveraging all of the work we have done, but a huge step forward going forward. And we and everyone else in the industry are still in the early innings. So, to give you a sense of where we are going at MAX, we talked about our vision for effectively not just creating content, but really engaging and embedding it in the existing workflows to create a creative copilot we refer to it as. And since then, we have been very hard at work at creating our own model, and the model that we are focused on is around output quality. So, it\u2019s about best-of-breed generative AI. But combining that with the Adobe magic that we have talked about over the years and all of the technology we have that takes images and makes them better, and so the output quality, we think is going to be differentiated. The second thing is around commercial reuse. There is a lot of complex questions here around copyrights, around diversity and inclusion, about harmful content that\u2019s being created. That\u2019s something we take very seriously, and we are embedding that into everything we do. And the third thing is really about workflow integration. Creating an image is just the start. It\u2019s not the end. And Adobe is the only player that has a full end-to-end workflow, not just within the products and the tools that we have in the digital media business, but also everything that Anil is doing around the content workflow and the content supply chain out to the point of distribution. And in fact, because of this, we are seeing other gentech companies wanting to partner with us more and more, and so we feel like we are in a really advantaged position where we are going to come out with our own model and we are going to be partnering with others to make sure that because of our distribution and the place we play in the market, we can bring a lot of this value to actual fruition. And stay tuned, next week at Summit, where we have a lot of exciting announcements and progress to make there. And then last to your, I think fourth or fifth question.\nKash Rangan: Monetization, yes, correct.\nDavid Wadhwani: Monetization, we are very excited about what this means for the business. New user onboarding. We think that, again, if you can start to imagine yourself as creative by using a text prompt, we can take you through that full journey and onboard you into other Adobe offerings. It\u2019s also great for retention. We have always seen the more value that gets used in our core offerings, the better the retention rates and the better the LTV. And we think there is up-sell opportunity. We do think these are distinct new packages that we can bring to market and up-sell people to.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Please go ahead.\nJay Vleeschhouwer: Thank you. Good evening. David, for you first, when we spoke at MAX on the subject of monetization, you alluded to Adobe\u2019s plans for new pricing and packaging, and you alluded to that this evening. But there was a third ingredient that you also alluded to at the time, which was segmentation, which sounded to me like something that you have success with back in the pre-CC days. And so is this something that you could talk about in terms of your returning to the segmentation techniques of the past that work rather well for the company? And then for Anil, it\u2019s interesting to hear the reference to your competition with single product companies. That\u2019s not a new phenomenon, of course. You have had multi-solution DX portfolio for some time. So, would you say, therefore that the wins or magnitude of the wins against single product competitors is more pronounced now? It\u2019s a larger part of the DX business? And would you say that the investments that you have evidently been making over the last year in consulting capacity has been a critical enabling ingredient for the growth you are now seeing in DX?\nDavid Wadhwani: Yes. So, starting with the DME side, Jay, for broad understanding, what we talked about at Adobe MAX was this recognition that since we introduced Creative Cloud 10 years or 11 years ago, we have now a much more comprehensive set of capabilities all the way from a freemium model with Adobe Express, all the way to our high-end creative cloud offerings, but also additional capabilities and packages beyond that like Substance and like Frame and like Stock that allow people to go beyond what they can do with the core creative products. The second thing that, in addition to that expansion that\u2019s happened is that as we have been driving more with DDAM [ph] and more with product-led growth, we are starting to automatically segment customers, not necessarily today in terms of what they buy, but how they experience the products that they are using already. And so what that leads to is an opportunity. And then going back to all the levers that we have for ongoing growth, there is the opportunity to start segmenting them earlier in the purchase flow into offers and offers that meet their needs and optimize the value to the price in a way that benefits our customers and of course also benefits Adobe. So, you can expect to see us continuing to play with everything from how we get new users, how we up-sell users, how we retain them, new businesses we bring in, but also pricing and packaging to your point.\nShantanu Narayen: And just to punctuate that maybe a little bit, Jay. I mean the reality is that we actually have different pricing for different devices today, which is completely different. We have web-based pricing for people who come and experience this as a result of a web search that they have made more successfully through Acrobat Web, for example. And so if the question is when we have had things like design collection or web collection or video collection, I mean the reality is the CCO laps, which actually had a really good quarter, is perceived by people to be the new sort of table stakes for what is happening in creative, and we think that that\u2019s a great offering. And as David said, I mean whether it\u2019s Stock or whether it is Substance and our 3D offerings, what we are doing there, those are really perceived to be the differential offerings that are personalized. And for a Photoshop customer, how do we get them to use one of these other offerings. So, I think we have done a really good job on that particular front.\nAnil Chakravarthy: Yes. From the DX perspective, we obviously started investing in AEP 5 years ago. Now we have lots of examples of customers who are using some of the capabilities like unified profile or the real-time CDP and the real-time performance at scale in production. So, from a customers\u2019 perspective, if they think about a single product, they actually know what an integrated product looks like, and they realize that that\u2019s what they would have to build together, build on their own. So, I think that\u2019s making the choice of going with a product from Adobe, which is already integrated with also best-in-class applications versus a single product where they would have to put it together. I think that\u2019s making the contrast more stark.\nShantanu Narayen: And there is more scrutiny, wouldn\u2019t you say, Anil, that so I think part of what\u2019s happening is as the IT or the Chief Marketing Officer, the Chief Digital Officer is thinking about this holistically. There is more scrutiny around who is the company that can provide us the more comprehensive solutions. So, that \u2013 you have seen, Jay, a certain difference in how customers are viewing that, which again plays to our strengths.\nJay Vleeschhouwer: Thank you.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from the line of Saket Kalia with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nSaket Kalia: Okay. Great. Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question here and well done in the quarter as well. I would love to dig into Figma a little bit, understanding very well that it\u2019s still in process. And so David, maybe for you, I know you and the team see the opportunities with products like FigJam in really complementing Creative Cloud. I was wondering if you have seen other opportunities for some of that complementary sort of opportunity as you spend more time with the business. And then, Dan, maybe just a quick housekeeping question. Can you just remind us sort of what the revenue overlap looks like with Figma? I believe it\u2019s the Adobe XD product where specifically where there is overlap, but maybe you could just remind us sort of what that revenue overlap looks like?\nShantanu Narayen: Yes. Saket, maybe I will first jump in. I mean I think just let\u2019s remember before they answer, these are two separate companies, and so we are operating at arm\u2019s length in terms of what they are doing. I think we have shared upfront that the XD revenue is de minimis, and so that\u2019s the part that I wanted to get across. And then David can certainly speak to some of the strategic rationale and ideas for what we can do.\nDavid Wadhwani: Yes. So, I think there is a ton of opportunity in terms of how we look at the Figma business and figure out Figma opportunity. First of all, as we have discussed, we believe that we can just fundamentally accelerate what they are doing today in product design. We have a global footprint. We are working with a lot of our \u2013 with enterprise customers across the globe, and the feedback that we are getting from these enterprise customers is a lot of excitement about the kind of things we can do by bringing these two companies together to just accelerate and make them more productive in terms of what they want to accomplish and just accelerate everything that they are doing. The second thing is around taking workflows between Photoshop and Illustrator and Figma and really just operationalizing them in a way that we can bring real-time collaboration capabilities based on the Figma platform to these \u2013 to the core disciplines like illustration and video editing and photography and 3D design and more. And the third is really around the evolution with FigJam, bringing that into the core for productivity use cases. So, taking FigJam and integrating it more deeply with things like Acrobat and starting to just recognize that creativity is starting to be the foundation of how new productivity applications need to present themselves. And that whole motion of enabling productivity workers to express themselves creatively is where the market is going with the rise of the creator economy. And so we see \u2013 we just see a ton of opportunities to integrate the products. We can\u2019t \u2013 we are limited in what we can talk to them about in a moment. But what I can say is everyone from Adobe employees to Figma employees, to our customers, can\u2019t wait for this to close so we can actually get moving on all this.\nSaket Kalia: Very helpful. Thanks guys.\nJonathan Vaas: Operator, we are just about at the top of the hour. We will take one more question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nBrent Thill: Shantanu, on the DX business, I am just curious if you could just give us an overview of what you are seeing there. Are you still seeing the big deals? Are you seeing a smaller number of \u2013 higher number of smaller transactions, anything? Can you just talk through the pipeline? Just general kind of set up, what you are seeing in terms of the overall DX business and how customers are behaving?\nShantanu Narayen: Happy to, Brent, and I hope we get to see you next week at Summit because then you willalso get to meet a whole bunch of customers. I think \u2013 and Anil, certainly feel free to add. I mean I think we saw some really good transformational deals. I think both Dan and Anil referred to that. And so companies that are looking at Adobe to help them with their entire end-to-end customer experience management, good strength there, Brent. I mean those tend to be ones that we have worked with for many years and some that are really looking at it as a strategic. So, I would say that segment, the pipeline associated with people who are looking for a comprehensive and integrated CXM solution is pretty large. I think as it relates to what we call the solution-led segment as well, which is people who may have our analytic solutions and want content solutions or those who have both of those and want journey optimizer or customer journey analytics or certainly the commerce solutions, that\u2019s another part of the business where we are making sure that we can up-sell. I know Anil typically at every FA meeting gives you stats and metrics on how we are making progress. So, that is one. Given we have the customer relationship and we have the customer engagement, and we have customer success managers, I think continuing to penetrate a customer account, that\u2019s where also we see pipeline. And that\u2019s a pipeline that\u2019s driven, frankly, by us. I think in terms of the geographies, we continue to see strength in North America. I think when you think about EMEA, that remains an area of strength. There are some areas in Asia, some countries in Asia. So, our job there, really, Brent, has been how do you drive a large pipeline, understanding that there is going to be different companies that look at this differently in specific quarter, but we are focused on the addressable market. Anil, I don\u2019t know if you have other stuff to add.\nAnil Chakravarthy: I think the only thing I would say is I think the themes that we are going to hit on at Summit, personalization at scale, content supply chain, even for customers who are starting with a single product, they like that vision because they know that, that is what is key to driving the digital growth and driving profitable growth. So, even if they are starting with one and focusing on value realization, they have their eye on a longer term roadmap, and that benefits our relationship with them.\nShantanu Narayen: And Brent, the other thing I will say, given just the last question is, I think at Summit, you will see some of the themes. I mean certainly, content has been a theme for us for a long time. Data has been a theme for us for a long time. The focus on customer platform and CDP has been a big one. I think how this spreads its tentacles into the product and PLG as David has said, so I think we have some exciting things that we will talk about in that particular space in AI and how AI can help. So, we are not just resting on what we have today as an integrated offering. We are really the innovative product roadmap across each one of our businesses, what Dave has been doing in creative, what\u2019s happening in documents on the web and mobile devices and what Anil is going to show. I think that\u2019s also what gives us a lot of confidence that we are anticipating and solving customer problems. And so it was a strong start to Q1. And based on the product innovation, we really continue to be excited about the opportunity that we have at Adobe, and we look forward to seeing all of you at Summit.\nJonathan Vaas: Thanks everyone for joining the call. Like Shantanu said, we hope to see many of you next Tuesday at Summit. I look forward to talking to many of you soon and this concludes the call.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today\u2019s meeting. Thank you for your attendance and you may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "ADBE", "quarter": 4, "year": 2022, "date": "2022-12-15 20:54:04", "content": "Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Q4 and FY\u201922 Adobe Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to Jonathan Vaas, Vice President of Investor Relations.

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. 2022 was an exciting and eventful year for Adobe. We achieved record revenue of $17.61 billion, representing 15% year-over-year growth. GAAP earnings per share was $10.10 and non-GAAP earnings per share was $13.71. We delivered record operating cash flows with a focus on profitability. Our strong performance in the uncertain macroeconomic environment underscores the resilience of our business and the mission-critical role of our products in a digital-first world. Our strategy to unleash creativity for all, accelerate document productivity and power digital businesses is driving momentum across every geography and customer segment, making us one of the most innovative, diversified, and profitable software companies in the world. We continue to execute against our product roadmap, serve a vast customer universe from individuals to large enterprises and deliver strong top and bottom line growth. Adobe Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and Experience Cloud have become the foundation of Digital Experiences, starting with the first creative spark, to the creation and development of all content and media, to the personalized delivery across every channel. In Q4, we achieved revenue of $4.53 billion, representing 14% year-over-year growth. In our Digital Media business, we had our best quarter ever on net new ARR, delivering $576 million, and our Digital Experience business achieved its first $1 billion subscription revenue quarter, growing 16% year-over-year. I will now pass it to David.\nDavid Wadhwani: Thanks, Shantanu, and hello, everyone. The demand for digital content across every creative category, customer segment and media type is accelerating at a rapid pace. Creative Cloud remains the leading creativity platform, offering a comprehensive portfolio of products for every discipline across imaging, photography, design, video, web, animation and 3D. Core products such as Photoshop, Lightroom, Illustrator, Premiere Pro and Acrobat continue to lead their categories as we add new features and enhance their capabilities with Adobe Sensei, our AI engine. The rapid progress we\u2019re making with Adobe Express is attracting millions of new users and delivering additional value to Creative Cloud members who are also interested in lightweight, task-oriented tools. New collaboration capabilities, like Share for Review, are integrated directly into Creative Cloud and Document Cloud applications to enable seamless creation, sharing and review across creative and document workflows. Our ongoing product innovation ensures that Adobe remains the preeminent destination for a wide and growing base of individuals, students, creative professionals, small business owners and enterprises to create and monetize amazing content more quickly and easily than ever before. Q4 was a record quarter for Creative Cloud. We achieved net new Creative Cloud ARR of $453 million and revenue of $2.68 billion, which grew 13% year-over-year. This strong performance was a result of: demand for our flagship applications, including Photoshop, Lightroom, Illustrator, Premiere Pro and Acrobat; expansion in SMB and enterprise, driven by strong execution of our year-end pipeline across direct sales and our reseller channel; accelerating growth in Substance 3D and Frame.io, underscoring the continued strength and significant opportunities in our newer businesses; momentum in Express, our template-based web and mobile product for creating everything from year-end sales promotions to holiday cards to social media posts. Express\u2019 unparalleled collection of stock images, videos, fonts, design assets and templates and its unique integration of AI magic from Photoshop, Premiere Pro and Acrobat enable us to deliver the best of Adobe to customers of every skill level. Q4 continued to see exciting growth with millions of monthly active users, greater than 40% quarter-over-quarter visitor growth in the U.S., and an NPS greater than 50. Key customer wins include Electronic Arts, Meta, NBC Universal, Publicis, Roku, Target and United Nations. In October, we were thrilled to be back live with thousands of members from our creative community at Adobe MAX. The conference has always been an opportunity to showcase our incredible innovation, and we drove over a quarter of a billion video views across all channels. Our announcements included: powerful new AI capabilities in Photoshop, such as a one-click Delete and Fill tool to remove and replace objects, and a new Photo Restoration neural filter that instantly fixes damaged photos; a Share for Review service in Photoshop and Illustrator that enables designers to easily collaborate with key stakeholders; the first-to-market Camera to Cloud integration between Frame.io and RED Digital Camera and Fujifilm, significantly reducing production costs and time; advances in Substance 3D that empower brands such as Electronic Arts, Hugo Boss, NASCAR, NVIDIA and The Coca-Cola Company to create engaging immersive experiences; a new partnership between the Content Authenticity Initiative and Leica and Nikon to implement provenance technology into cameras, allowing photographers to embed when, where and how images were captured; and early demonstrations of Adobe\u2019s Generative AI technology integrated into our tools, which promises to transform the creative process, making it more accessible, fast and efficient than ever before. Now turning to the Document Cloud business, digital documents have become synonymous with productivity in our personal and professional lives, whether it\u2019s an offer to purchase a new home, a bank deposit form, a school permission slip or a sales contract. Document Cloud is the leader in digital documents, offering innovative solutions across every device and for every skill level. Our strategy to enable all common document actions, including editing, sharing, reviewing, scanning and signing across desktop, mobile and web, is paying strong dividends. In Q4, Document Cloud had record revenue of $619 million, which represents 19% year-over-year growth and strong net new ARR of $123 million, with ending ARR growing 23% year-over-year. Q4 highlights include: new Acrobat functionality for SMBs, including the ability to send branded agreement templates and combine payments with e-signed documents; new capabilities between Document Cloud and Creative Cloud to help knowledge workers and creative professionals seamlessly collaborate and improve their productivity; scan innovation that allows users to simultaneously scan the left and right pages of a book as well as scan both sides of an ID card on one page; strong organic growth in both traffic and searches for PDF capabilities, which serve as a critical funnel to Acrobat web; significant growth in Sign transactions within Acrobat, underscoring the need for integrated document solutions; outstanding growth in API transactions. API calls nearly doubled quarter-over-quarter, demonstrating the strategic necessity of integrating PDF capabilities within enterprise applications; key customer wins include BioNTech, Cigna, Deloitte, Mitsubishi Electric, Raytheon, Shell Information Technology and the U.S. Department of State. Q4 was the strongest net new ARR quarter ever for Digital Media, driven by outstanding execution against multiple growth drivers in our core business. In addition, we\u2019re excited about the pending Figma acquisition, which represents a tremendous opportunity to accelerate the future of creativity and productivity for millions of people.  Overall, the regulatory process is proceeding as expected. The transaction is being reviewed globally, including by the Department of Justice and the Competition and Markets Authority in the UK. We are currently engaged in the DOJ\u2019s second request process. We expect that the transaction will also be reviewed in the EU. We continue to feel positive about the facts underlying the transaction and expect to receive approval to close the transaction in 2023. I\u2019ll now pass it to Anil.\nAnil Chakravarthy: Thanks, David. Hello everyone. Every business in every category now depends on digital to engage and transact with their customers. Adobe\u2019s Holiday Shopping Report, which analyzes trillions of data points in Adobe Analytics, found that Cyber Monday drove an all-time high of $11.3 billion in online spending, with mobile shopping now accounting for 55% of sales on Thanksgiving, and Buy Now Pay Later orders jumping 85% during Cyber Week. We predict spend will exceed $210 billion this holiday season. No company is better positioned than Adobe to capitalize on this large global opportunity. In my customer conversations, it\u2019s clear that the current macroeconomic climate requires businesses to prioritize investments, and digital remains mission-critical to drive operational efficiency, improve customer engagement and maximize long-term value realization. We are driving a mix of diversified revenue streams through subscription and consulting services across new and existing customers, demonstrating the strength of our business. Experience Cloud is powering digital businesses in every industry across B2B and B2C with our leading solutions spanning data insights and audiences, content and commerce, customer journeys and marketing workflow, and it is unique in that it helps businesses drive customer demand, engagement and growth while simultaneously delivering productivity gains. Our comprehensive set of applications, including Real-Time CDP, are built natively on our highly differentiated Adobe Experience Platform, providing companies with a unified profile of each of their customers to deliver the most personalized, real-time experiences at scale. Adobe Experience Platform processes 29 trillion segment evaluations per day and executes a response time of less than 250 milliseconds, illustrating the impact of its real-time capabilities at scale. In Q4, we continued to drive strong growth in our Experience Cloud business, achieving $1.15 billion in revenue. Subscription revenue was $1.01 billion, our first billion-dollar quarter and representing 16% year-over-year growth. Adobe is differentiated in our ability to power the entire customer experience, from ideation to content creation to personalized delivery to monetization. Chipotle is a great example. They are using Creative Cloud to design content for web and mobile channels and Experience Cloud to highlight new product offerings based on consumer preferences and support a faster, easier and more customized online ordering process. In government, the State of Illinois is using Experience Cloud and Document Cloud to provide simpler and more equitable access to state services for over 12 million residents. It's especially inspiring to witness the positive social impact of Adobe technology. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children has long used Photoshop to create age-progressed photos and uses Experience Cloud to facilitate the recovery of missing children. Additional Q4 highlights include: strong demand for Adobe Experience Platform and native applications, inclusive of Real-Time CDP, Adobe Journey Optimizer and Customer Journey Analytics, which are rapidly becoming the digital underpinning of large brands globally; accelerating demand for Adobe Experience Manager, demonstrating Adobe\u2019s role in helping businesses effectively manage their content supply chain, from creation to monetization; a new Marketing Mix Modeling service as part of our data insights and audiences offering, which enables marketers to harness the power of Adobe Sensei to assess marketing ROI in weeks rather than months and forecast resources for campaigns more effectively; strong growth in partner and Adobe professional services, underscoring our customers\u2019 continued focus on implementation and value realization; key customer wins, including BlackRock, Chipotle, Delta Air Lines, DFS Group, Disney Parks, Elevance Health, GM, Office Depot, Publicis, Santander and Wells Fargo. Adobe continued to receive strong industry analyst recognition, including leadership in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for B2B Marketing Automation Platforms, the Forrester Wave for Collaborative Work Management and the Forrester Wave for Enterprise Marketing Suites. I\u2019ll now pass it to Dan.\nDan Durn: Thanks, Anil. Our earnings report today covers both, Q4 and fiscal year 2022 results. As you know, in 2022 we experienced significant headwinds from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, increased tax rates and the impacts from the Russia-Ukraine war. Despite those headwinds, in fiscal \u201822 Adobe achieved record revenue of $17.61 billion, which represents 12% year-over-year growth, or 15% growth in constant currency on an adjusted basis. GAAP EPS for the year was $10.10, and non-GAAP EPS was $13.71. We exceeded our initial Non-GAAP EPS target for fiscal year \u201822, which speaks to the discipline, strong execution and resilient operating model of the Company. Fiscal year 22 business and financial highlights included: Digital Media revenue of $12.84 billion; net new Digital Media ARR of $1.91 billion; Digital Experience revenue of $4.42 billion; cash flows from operations of $7.84 billion; RPO of $15.19 billion exiting the year; and repurchasing approximately 15.7 million shares of our stock during the year at a cost of $6.30 billion. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year \u201822, Adobe achieved revenue of $4.53 billion, which represents 10% year-over-year growth, or 14% in constant currency. GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q4 was $2.53 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was a record $3.60. Q4 business and financial highlights included: Digital Media revenue of $3.30 billion; record net new Digital Media ARR of $576 million; Digital Experience revenue of $1.15 billion; record cash flows from operations of $2.33 billion; adding over $1 billion to RPO sequentially in the quarter; and repurchasing approximately 5 million shares of our stock. In our Digital Media segment, we achieved Q4 revenue of $3.30 billion, which represents 10% year-over-year growth, or 14% in constant currency. We exited the quarter with $13.97 billion of Digital Media ARR. We achieved Creative revenue of $2.68 billion, which represents 8% year-over-year growth, or 13% in constant currency, and we added $453 million of net new Creative ARR in the quarter. Driving this performance was good linearity throughout the quarter as well as strong customer purchasing during the peak holiday shopping weeks. Fourth quarter Creative growth drivers included: new user growth, fueled by customer demand, targeted campaigns and promotions, and yearend seasonal strength, which drove strong web traffic and conversion rates in the quarter; adoption of our Creative Cloud All Apps offerings across customer segments, from enterprise, to Team, to individual and education; strength of the new Acrobat within our Creative Cloud offering, demonstrating the importance of digital documents and workflows to the creative community; sales of individual applications, including a strong quarter for our imaging and photography offerings; continued growth of newer businesses, including Express, Substance, Frame and Stock; and a solid finish to the year in SMB and enterprise. Adobe achieved Document Cloud revenue of $619 million, which represents 16% year-over-year growth, or 19% in constant currency. We added $123 million of net new Document Cloud ARR in the quarter. Fourth quarter Document Cloud growth drivers included: Acrobat subscription demand across all customer segments; continued growth of Acrobat web, fueled by online searches for PDF and product-led growth; strong performance of our new Acrobat offering integrated with Sign, driving upsell ARR as well as new customer adoption; and year-end seasonal strength in SMB, including through our reseller channel. Turning to our Digital Experience segment, in Q4 we achieved revenue of $1.15 billion and subscription revenue of $1.01 billion, both of which represent 14% year-over-year growth, or 16% in constant currency. Fourth quarter Digital Experience growth drivers included: expected year-end strength, with significant bookings of our newer offerings in EMEA that builds on our momentum in North America; success closing numerous transformational deals that span our portfolio of solutions; momentum with our Adobe Experience Platform and native applications, including RealTime CDP; strength with our Content and Workfront solutions, which are integral components of our content supply chain strategy; and increased customer demand for professional services, as enterprises focus on implementation and accelerating time to value realization from digital investments. In Q4, we focused on making disciplined investments to drive growth and awareness of our products. We continue to have world-class gross and operating margins and drove strong EPS performance in the quarter. Adobe\u2019s effective tax rate in Q4 was 22.5% on a GAAP basis and 17.5% on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP tax rate came in lower than expected primarily due to lower-than-projected tax on our foreign earnings. RPO exiting the quarter was $15.19 billion, growing 9% year-over-year, or 12% when factoring in a 3 percentage-point FX headwind. Our ending cash and short-term investment position exiting Q4 was $6.10 billion, and cash flows from operations in the quarter were a record $2.33 billion, up 14% year-over-year. We now intend to use cash on hand to repay the current portion of our debt on or before the due date, which we expect will reduce our interest expense in fiscal year \u201823. In Q4 we entered into a $1.75 billion share repurchase agreement, and we currently have $6.55 billion remaining of our $15 billion authorization granted in December 2020 which goes through 2024. As a reminder, we measure ARR on a constant currency basis during a fiscal year and revalue ARR at year-end for current currency rates. FX rate changes between December of 2021 and this year have resulted in a $712 million decrease to the Digital Media ARR balance entering fiscal year \u201823, which is now $13.26 billion after the revaluation. This is reflected in our updated investor data sheet, and ARR results will be measured against this amount during fiscal year \u201823. We provided preliminary fiscal year \u201823 targets at our Financial Analyst Meeting in October that take into account the macroeconomic environment and the growth drivers for our various businesses. While there is ongoing macro uncertainty, given the massive long-term opportunity in digital and the momentum in our business, we are pleased to reiterate those financial targets. In summary, for fiscal year \u201823 we are targeting: total Adobe revenue of $19.1 to $19.3 billion; Digital Media net new ARR of approximately $1.65 billion; Digital Media segment revenue of $13.9 to $14.0 billion; Digital Experience segment revenue of $4.925 billion to $5.025 billion; Digital Experience subscription revenue of $4.375 billion to $4.425 billion; tax rate of approximately 22% on a GAAP basis and 18.5% on a non-GAAP basis; GAAP earnings per share of $10.75 to $11.05; and non-GAAP earnings per share of $15.15 to $15.45. As a reminder, these targets do not contemplate our planned acquisition of Figma. We expect normal seasonality throughout the year, with Q1 being sequentially down and seasonally light for new business, sequential growth from Q1 to Q2, a dip in Q3 on account of summer seasonality, and a strong finish to the year in Q4. For Q1 fiscal year \u201823 we are targeting: total Adobe revenue of $4.60 billion to $4.64 billion; Digital Media net new ARR of approximately $375 million; Digital Media segment revenue of $3.35 billion to $3.375 billion; Digital Experience segment revenue of $1.16 billion to $1.18 billion; Digital Experience subscription revenue of $1.025 billion to $1.045 billion; tax rate of approximately 22% on a GAAP basis and 18.5% on a non-GAAP basis; GAAP earnings per share of $2.60 to $2.65; and non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.65 to $3.70. In summary, Adobe finished FY22 strong, executing on our strategies across Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and Experience Cloud. I expect this performance to carry into next year, as Adobe\u2019s sustained top-line growth and world-class profitability continue to position us well for fiscal year \u201823 and beyond. Shantanu, back to you.\nShantanu Narayen: Thanks, Dan. As the company celebrates its 40th anniversary, it is a perfect time to reflect on our past and our future. Adobe was founded on simple but enduring principles that remain with us today. Innovation is at our core, employees are our greatest asset and our customers, communities and shareholders are central to our success. Over the past four decades, Adobe\u2019s continuous innovation and leadership have empowered billions of people around the globe to imagine, create and deliver the best Digital Experiences. Our strong brand and company culture enable us to attract and retain the world\u2019s best employees. We are proud to once again be named to Interbrand\u2019s Best Global Brands list as a top riser for the 7th year in a row and to Wall Street Journal\u2019s Best Managed Companies, ranking number one for Employee Engagement and Development. We have everything it takes to continue our success in the future: massive market opportunities; a proven ability to create and expand categories that transform markets; an expansive product portfolio that serves a growing universe of customers; revolutionary technology platforms that advance our industry leadership and competitive advantage; an expanding ecosystem that delivers even greater value to customers; strong business fundamentals; and the most dedicated and talented employees. I have never been more certain that Adobe\u2019s best days are ahead. Thank you and we will now take questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll go ahead and take our first question from Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Please go ahead.\nMark Moerdler: Thank you very much, and congratulations on the quarter and the guidance, by the way. Can you give us, David, some more color on Adobe Express and your ability to convert free users to paid users? Are you seeing any impact to creative customers trying to switch to Express? And how do you assure express paid adoption with that impact on Creative Cloud?\nDavid Wadhwani: Yes. We're very excited about sort of the state of Express. Express just finished its first year in market. We have millions of monthly active users. As I mentioned, we saw very strong growth sequentially quarter-over-quarter in the U.S., which is our primary focus market, 40% quarter-over-quarter growth in visitors, terrific NPS of over 50%. And that's really on the backs of hundreds of millions of stock content that we have, the 20,000 fonts that we've added that is unique to our offering, the highest quality templates. And the constant addition of best-breed features from our other Adobe products like Photoshop and Premier and Acrobat. We've had over 100 releases in the first year that Express has been out. So, we're very excited about that. And so, the Express business itself continues to do well, both in terms of free users and in terms of conversion of those users. But to your question, we also are seeing very strong adoption of Express within our existing CC customer base. So, we see a lot of people, of course, buying our core flagship applications for the power and precision that they have and that they represent, but there are times in those users that are looking to just get something done quickly. And the fact that Express is also entitled to those users gives them the ability to have the power and precision and the speed and ease. And so as users are coming, we're bringing in more users than we've ever had in audiences, we haven't reached by finding intent-based search for things. We're bringing those users in, which is giving us incredible top of funnel. We're driving the conversion. And we're also able to drive utilization increases in CC customers, which is driving retention of that business overall as well. So, the funnel and that migration of that base is very healthy and playing out as expected.\nOperator: We'll go ahead and move on to our next question from Brad Sills with Bank of America.\nBrad Sills: I wanted to ask another question about Creative Cloud Express. Obviously, you're seeing some success here with that top of funnel business. Is there any color you can provide on where you see the upgrade path for some of those customers? Are there -- is there a certain upsell motion that we could see conversion of other products, even potentially the full suite in that installed base as it's growing? Thank you.\nDavid Wadhwani: Yes. As we talked about when we launched Creative Cloud Express, the primary focus right now is bringing people into Adobe Express and just making them successful, whether it's at the free tier or whether it's at the paid tier or whether it's a pay tier eventually migrating up into the core flagship applications. Our primary focus has been and continues to be right now around usage, repeat usage and utilization. We are seeing, though, while that's our primary focus, we are seeing a lot of really interesting data coming in suggesting that we -- that the upgrade has are -- while still early and not our primary focus are working. For example, in many higher ed institutions where we've started to deploy Adobe Express, we're starting to see not just the increase in terms of usage of Express, but we're also starting to see increase in demand for Adobe Creative Cloud flagship applications. And again, part of this is we know and we believe that everyone should be creative and creativity is the new productivity. But as people start to leverage and benefit from that creativity, they naturally want more power and precision as well. So that they do go well hand in hand.\nOperator: We'll move on to our next question from Sterling Auty with SVB MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.\nSterling Auty: So, I'm curious, is there anything operationally that you can do in preparation for the Figma acquisition, either from an expense structure or development side now before close? And if so, what are those moves that you're making?\nShantanu Narayen: Yes, Sterling, maybe I can speak to that. I mean, first, it's nice to see that since the deal was announced, the excitement associated with both what we can do as combined companies as well as, as you can see from our results, the interest in the core business. And so, we're excited overall associated with it. Certainly, as the regulatory bodies are looking at it, we can focus on thinking about strategically. We are getting a lot of great feedback from customers. But these are two separate independent companies. And as it relates to our own cost structure as well as our technology, we feel really good about all the prioritizations we've made. And so, we feel like we're uniquely positioned when it closes to immediately take advantage of it.\nOperator: We'll move on to our next question from Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nBrad Zelnick: My congrats as well on a strong finish to the year. Following up on Sterling's question, it's good to hear the Figma close process is moving forward as expected. Can you give us an update on how their business is trending, just relative to your commentary at the time the deal was announced, especially given the evolution of the macro environment since then? Thanks.\nShantanu Narayen: Brad, as you know, they're a private company. And so, we're certainly not at liberty to talk about it. And they have to continue to execute on their opportunity by themselves.\nBrad Zelnick: Okay. Understood. Thank you, Shantanu.\nOperator: We'll move on to our next question from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nMark Murphy: Thank you very much, and I'll add my congrats. So Shantanu, the amount of energy and excitement in the audience was quite impressive down at the MAX conference. And I'm wondering which of the innovations that you unveiled has created the most enthusiasm, which you might -- you think might also be monetizable? And I'm wondering whether it could be generative AI or that Share for Review capability, the intertwine capability or anything else really coming to the forefront.\nShantanu Narayen: Well, Mark, firstly, thanks for being there, and it's clear that you were also looking at all of the cool new innovative stuff that was delivered. I always worry about questions like that because it's, you know, which of my children do I love the most. But let me just speak to, I think, thematically, what David and Scott showed, which is the core applications. We just continue to make sure the core applications are more accessible, more productive, more fun. And so I think that's one area, thematically, that the team has done an outstanding job of making sure that we continue to deliver innovative capabilities. You mentioned Intertwine and Illustrator. I think the second thing, thematically, we talk about how do we get more people into the franchise. David also referred to that when he answered the two questions on Express, which is, the more we get people into the franchise, whether it's through our trial products, whether it's through Express, whether it's through participating in the collaborative process. I think that only adds to the available market for Adobe. And so, I think the work that we're doing in collaboration is really continuing to democratize what we can do. So, I'm pretty excited about that. I think the AI and the sneaks that you talked about, that really -- the potential for that when you see whether it was the individual fonts that were being done or whether your ability through a text, to be able to get your content done exactly the way it is. I'm sure you've been tracking also what's happened, Mark, in terms of the chat GPT and what you can do with respect to text. So, I think that entire space, our vision has always been anybody who has a creative idea, how do you get that creative idea to life. And so, I think moving from the hundreds of millions to billions of people who can use it. You're right, that has profound impact in terms of getting more people on our platform. And I think you'll see us be quite aggressive about delivering more of that functionality in an augmented way, perhaps first starting with Express. But I think we're excited about all of that. And the Frame acquisition certainly also is off. I think David and Dan spoke to Substance. So, we feel really good about the multiple growth drivers.\nDavid Wadhwani: If I can adjust a little bit to that. The three examples you brought are really interesting examples because intertwine is an example of the ongoing innovation in our existing flagship application. So that continues to drive an keep people engaged and onboarding into the applications and keep those -- keeps everything fresh and differentiated. Share for Review that initial release, while still early, we've been amazed by the repeat use of that once people start using it. And that represents a great growth loop for us. Because, as you know, anyone that gets shared a document, whether it's a Photoshop document or an Illustrator document or any other document is also an opportunity as a stakeholder to turn into a future user of Adobe products, whether it happens to be the Photoshop document to Photoshop usage or whether it happens to be driving people to try Adobe Express. So, those growth loops are really interesting and important to us as well. And I just wanted to make sure people saw that opportunity.\nOperator: The next question will come from Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Please go ahead.\nJay Vleeschhouwer: Shantanu, I'd like to ask about a term that you used often at MAX. And in fact, a new three-letter acronym that you use as well, namely product-led growth. And the question is Adobe has arguably been a product-led growth company for the more than 30 years that I've known you. And I'm wondering now what does product-led growth mean differently today from what it might have meant historically? And relatedly, how are you thinking about the cross-sell and upsell opportunity that you also spoke about at MAX, specifically for 2023.\nShantanu Narayen: Yes. Jay, thanks for recognizing that our innovation has really come through an extremely close relationship with customers. So, I think in the past, in the desktop era, what product-led growth really was all about was making sure that as we engage with the customers, as we engage with the community, that we were able to use that. I think the best example perhaps in the desktop era was what we did with Lightroom. And when we first came up with Lightroom, given the fact that we had Photoshop already as a product, just getting the millions of people to use it even before we release the product, having all those evangelists and a great product, I think was a great example. What the team in both Creative Cloud and frankly, in the Experience Cloud, are doing is actually also following on the great work that we pioneered in the Document Cloud. And so, in the Document Cloud, I think product-led growth really related to as we think about what people were doing on searches when we introduced our web-based offerings for Acrobat, that's when we just started to see this velocity of how we engage with customers and prioritizing what's clearly top of mind for them, our ability to immediately satisfy them, I think, escalated quite a bit. When David came in, David really said, we've got to take this to a whole new level with product-led growth, and it's integrating both the community as well as, frankly, right now, engagement and engagement marketing in the product. And so when you get into product sessions right now, and you see the product manager and the engineering manager as well as the product marketing manager, all of them are on the same page. We have data. We have things instrumented in the products and your ability to do both AB testing and here's where we use our own products and the products that Anil does. And so, product-led growth right now is about saying, at any given time, we probably have three tests in market for a particular feature as well. And we're using that to really learn from the customer interactions and to deliver better quality products sooner. But David has really been the pioneer. So, David, if you'd like to add? And then maybe a little bit, Anil, on what we are doing for that in Digital Experience as well.\nDavid Wadhwani: Yes, Shantanu, I think that was a pretty complete summary. The only thing I would add is that there's an interesting inflection point that we are in terms of our product development cycles that give us an opportunity to take what we've always been doing, to your point, with product-led growth and drive even more use of it, which is the introduction of all the web applications that we have. So, we now have Photoshop Web, we have Illustrator Web, we have Acrobat Web, we have Adobe Express, and you combine that with the sharing focus that we have with Share for Review as an example. And we have new growth loops that we can start optimizing, and that's been a huge area of focus for the teams.\nAnil Chakravarthy: Yes. I just wanted to add, Shantanu, as you said, several of our enterprise customers are starting to deploy their own product-led growth using our analytics technology, a banking customer, for example, one of our best customers. They have their online mortgage application, and they want to track who is able to use it successfully, who's able to complete applications completely online, and they're using our analytics technology to do that and see what works and what they need to do to fix it. So, we're starting to see like exactly, as you said, our technology being both used inside Adobe to drive our own PLG as well as customers doing it.\nShantanu Narayen: And Jay, maybe to get to your second question and taking a step back, I do have to say, when we look at our annual targets that we had provided for Digital Media ARR at the beginning of the year of $1.9 billion. And I know even with our Q4 guide, I think people had some questions about where is the momentum. And I think the team crushed that, which I feel really good about. And so, a lot of that is happening as a result of just first, attracting and acquiring customers to the platform. And then what you're referring to is the cross-sell, upsell, whether it's people who first engage with us on a mobile device, whether it's people in Acrobat. We've used Adobe Reader as a very, very good on-ramp to allow people to engage with PDF functionality and then either get a license for our Acrobat web product or for the desktop product. Individual apps, the success and the driving of individual apps has always been an on ramp, and we then do a really good job because we use Adobe Experience platform to then convert them and even promotional pricing. I know we've had some questions in the past. And we have incredible data that shows us when people come in, whether that's on educational pricing and then they graduate or on promotional pricing, converting them to customers. So, I think there are numerous ways in which we've demonstrated that by personalizing our offer to every creative or knowledge worker that we're able to monetize that as well after they derive the value from it.\nOperator: We'll move on to Derrick Wood with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.\nDerrick Wood: Congrats on a strong net new ARR customer -- quarter. I wanted to ask about the composition of this number. The growth dynamic between Creative Cloud and Document Cloud was a little surprising. I mean Creative Cloud had, I think, the second strongest sequential percentage growth Q4 ever. But looking at Document Cloud, net new ARR didn't grow much sequentially in what's typically a stronger uptick in Q4. Can you just give a little more color on the seasonal dynamics you saw between Creative and Document Cloud in the quarter?\nDavid Wadhwani: Sure. Yes, I'm happy to do that. So first of all, yes, as Shantanu mentioned, we're very pleased with how FY22 has gone and how the quarter closed out, we saw a lot of strength in the core businesses. And our primary focus across these businesses continues to be around new customer acquisition, new customer ads. We also have a lot of diversity in terms of the drivers that we have and the leverage we have to drive the business. As we mentioned, we saw great strength across all of our creative segments imaging, photo, video, design. We also grew a lot of -- focused a lot in terms of new campaigns that are targeting new audiences for creative as well with a new campaign called Everyone can Photoshop, that's bringing customers in directly into the products and has been very productive in terms of driving top of funnel and conversion. On the -- in terms of new businesses for Creative, we're seeing a lot of strength from new businesses like Frame and Substance that have contributed more this quarter than ever before. And to your point, we've also been seeing a lot of strength in the core business around Acrobat. We're running a Acrobat\u2019s Got It campaign really targeted at new customers in SMB where we show them all the capabilities that Acrobat has now, including specifically focused on signatures and things that really help them drive the business. So overall, the business is doing very well. The one dynamic that -- if you look at from an Acrobat perspective that we're really proud of too, is that we saw -- for the year, we saw growth of ARR at 23% despite the complicated macro. And it's important to remember that some portion of this is also -- the Acrobat business is also represented in the creative business. So, the Acrobat growth number is probably a bit understated in this point.\nOperator: We'll move on to our next question from Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.\nMichael Turrin: Maybe one on the digital price side. We fielded some questions there just around guidance for next year in the current backdrop. You're holding on targets, grew well at 16% in constant currency for the quarter. So, can you just talk more around how much visibility you have in the targets there and it's how you closed the year at all, particularly given that EMEA comment provides incremental confidence in those targets going forward. Thank you.\nAnil Chakravarthy: Thanks for the question. We are pleased with the performance of the Digital Experience business. I mean just as a quick reminder, at the beginning of the year, we had guided DX at 17% of digital growth for the year, which is what we achieved in a really tough year with all the different macro issues. So if I really take a step back, we're -- first of all, we're in a really strong position with our product portfolio. We are a clear leader in the market with the investments we made at the Adobe Experience platform starting 5 years ago. And that is really paying off with the book of business that we are seeing and all the customer adoption that we are seeing. And what we are hearing from our conversations with our customers is that they're really eager to invest in a platform that enables them to meet the mission-critical priorities around digital. And that's what we are enabling them and personalization in real time at scale. So, this is a significantly large opportunity. And what we believe is that as we go through this time, single product companies are going to come under a lot of scrutiny. So, while we definitely see deals getting scrutinized and going up to higher levels for approval, we also see that customers really want to invest in a market leader like us for their investments, it's going to last the next 10, 15 years to -- for the digital investment. So pleased with where we are.\nShantanu Narayen: Maybe Anil, I'll just add a couple of things to what you said. I mean the first is that value realization has been top of mind for a lot of these customers. And so, I think if you look at the business as well, the services part, it's very clear that people want to implement it. And what I think is unique about Adobe's offerings in this particular space is that we help both with the customer engagement and frankly, the top of funnel as well as we help with productivity and cost. And so, it doesn't matter which side of that equation you are as, as an enterprise, I think both of them find that the Adobe Experience Cloud as well as, frankly, what we are doing with Sign actually help them on both fronts. And so we're pleased associated with that, and we have good visibility. I want to complement Anil and his team on the execution against the pipeline and transformational deals also, I think, just reflect the overarching interest that people have in making sure digital continues to be an imperative. And so, we're not going to be immune to the macroeconomic, but I like our differentiated solution and our execution.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nBrent Thill: Thanks. Dan, in terms of your guide, are you implying the environment gets worse or stays the same. And for Shantanu, can you just talk about the next 6 to 9 months as we potentially go into a tougher economic headwind, how you're reshaping and rethinking your go-to-market or any steps that you can take to ensure you can cut through what is coming in.\nDan Durn: Yes. So, from a guide standpoint, we spent a lot of time talking about the environment we're in during FA day. Against that backdrop, you can see the momentum of the business. You can see the execution against the opportunities. What I really like about the way we're positioned in the market. There's a diversification of the company. It's end markets, it's product segments, it's business models, it gives us a resilience in the environment that we're in, and we see that in the momentum we're carrying into next year. There's really no change to the view of the environment that we're in, and you see that reflected in the targets that we set for 2023. So, we feel good about the way we're executing against a complicated macro environment, and we'll continue to stay focused on adding value to our customers, but there's a diversification and a resilience to who we are and a mission criticality of what we sell to our customers. And then you could see that in the comment that Shantanu made. You can see us impacting the company's top line. You can see us impacting the productivity with which they serve their customers, and that puts us in a pretty unique position.\nShantanu Narayen: And Brent, as it relates to your second question, I'll unpack that in maybe two ways. First is we're really pleased with what we did and even when the pandemic first started about prioritizing what was really critical for us. And I think the prioritization exercise when you're really focused on your top imperatives, that's really helped bring clarity and alignment within the company that I don't think should be undersold in terms of how effective that has been for execution. As it relates to the next 6 or 9 months and you think about the three routes to market, digital continues to be an area of strength. I mean, I know through our Adobe Digital Index we talk about what we are seeing in terms of people continuing to engage with the customers -- companies that they want to transact with electronically. And so, on the digital side, we will just continue to make sure we focus on acquiring the customers. David spoke to some of the effective campaigns. Clearly, we understand the attribution of that. And we just have to remain vigilant on making sure that we're attracting the customers on the new platforms where they exist. And for retention, which is a key issue as well, just how they continue to get value from the offerings that they have. The partner ecosystem, whether that's for the small and medium business or whether that's for what we are doing with the SI and VAR community on Digital Experience, just continuing to enable them, continuing to engage with them. I think that's a part. Clearly, the small and medium business did see a rebound after what they went through last year, which was a really bad situation. So I think we have to remain vigilant on that. And I think on the direct sales part, as we look at our pipeline, December, despite the fact that it's our first month of our quarter, we will continue to focus on execution against that to take advantage of whatever budget flush exists in companies. And then, as you start to come to what happens in Japan in February as it's the end of their fiscal year, continuing to focus on Europe. Brent, Europe was actually one of the highlights for us in the quarter. I think Adobe Experience platform has done well. And so, we remain cautious clearly about the macroeconomic, but I think we have visibility into making sure that we can continue to execute, Brent.\nOperator: We'll go ahead and move on to our next question from Keith Bachman with BMO. Please go ahead.\nKeith Bachman: Hi. Thank you very much. And apologize in advance for some background noise. Shantanu and David, I wanted to direct this to you, if I could. The ARR net new in the quarter was very good, particularly relative to expectations. If we look back over a little longer period of time though than the quarter, growth has slowed in net new ARR, even if it's assuming of flattening out. And what I didn't -- what we didn't really get -- I think as much as we would have liked at the Analyst Day was, what do you think the key drivers of the net new ARR and creative have been or total ARR, if you want? And what are the key things that you're focused on before Figma that would cause an improvement in AR growth? I assume that one has been perhaps Adobe Express as a more compelling entry point. Is there anything else that you can call out as some things that you believe that Adobe is focused on like really some issues in the past that you think are going to be resolved and therefore before Figma but improve despite the macro or help growth in the creative side? Many thanks.\nDavid Wadhwani: Yes. I'm happy to jump in and Shantanu can add anything. So at a high level, if you look at what we've talked about at Analyst Day, our strategy is very clear, which is new users and retention are the core drivers and focus areas. As Shantanu mentioned, we're being very focused and very intentional in terms of those two things. When it comes to new subscribers, we added more new commercial subscribers this year than we've ever added in our history. And that is a really important intentional sort of activities we are doing. Many of those new users are -- tend to be nonprofessionals, right, or they tend to be earlier in career professionals. And so, they are coming in and leveraging our initial single app plan or Adobe Express, as an example, and we're very happy to have them take that on because we believe very strongly that the opportunities to drive and upsell them from Express to single app and from single app to all apps, is going to be something that is persistent and something that is very ready and available to us at the time we need. The main thing, though, is about getting them into the products and making them successful. And so with that focus, we've been very -- we've also been maniacally operational about retention of those bases. I think people have asked questions, as you broaden the net, you bring in other users that are not typical Adobe users, what's happening to the retention rates. I think we also shared that we're seeing usage of products continues to stay very strong as we bring in these new audiences. And we're starting -- and we're seeing retention continue to tick up and improve. And in fact, retention now is better than it was pre-pandemic as an example. So, we continue to bring in new users. We continue to retain those new users and we see organic opportunities to move them up and upgrade them. Shantanu mentioned a great example of education. We continue to see a lot of people come in with our education pricing. And then, we have the opportunity, two years or three years later when they graduate to upgrade them to full commercial pricing. And those activities are playing out as expected, and we see a lot more opportunity to it. But it all comes down to bringing new users in, getting them using the products a lot and retaining them.\nShantanu Narayen: And maybe to add to that, Keith. I mean, when you think about the newer businesses that we're talking about, video just continues to be a really key growth driver, 3D and immersive imaging and photography. But if you take a step back, I think that two things happening in the macroeconomic environment that are actually going to be tailwinds. The first is the fact that it is the golden age of design. Everybody would like to express themselves. There are more screens on which all of this content is being consumed. So, I think the insatiable consumer demand for content, I think, is certainly driving a lot of more content that's being created. One of the exciting areas that I think David and Anil have talked about is what we are calling content supply chain. And when you take even the larger companies, they are all trying to get a handle of as they engage digitally with customers how much content is being created? Where is it being created? Where is it being delivered? How do I localize it? What's the efficacy of that content? And so, I think this content supply chain and everything we have with our creative applications, our asset management, the fact that we then deliver that content, I think we continue to believe that that's going to be a growth driver for the entire business as well. So, I wouldn't underestimate the insatiable consumer demand but I also wouldn't underestimate what's happening as enterprises recognize that the way to engage with people is to personalize that content.\nJonathan Vaas: Hey operator, we're at the top of the hour. We'll make time for one more question, and then we'll wrap up. Thanks.\nOperator: You bet. We'll go ahead and take our last question from Alex Zukin with Wolf Research. Please go ahead.\nAlex Zukin: I apologize for any background noise. I guess we've heard a lot about the continuing growth initiatives in the demand environment, sounding like it's pretty resistant to any macro pressures I believe you're seeing at the moment. I'll ask the kind of other side of the equation. As you think about the levers that you have on the margin side, the discipline that you've been exhibiting. It does seem like over the last quarter and maybe the past few quarters, that margin story, that margin discipline has continued to exceed at least our expectations. So, as we look at the next year, as you think about the levers that you have in the business if the parts of the business should slow. Can you go through maybe walk through a little bit of where you see the opportunity to either, A, lean in or B, pull back? And also, how we should think about cash conversion in that scenario from a cash flow perspective. Thanks again.\nDan Durn: Yes. So from an operating performance standpoint, you rightfully point out, the Company is performing really, really well. But we're doing what we've always done inside the company, which is drive growth, deliver industry-leading products and innovation to our customers, help them become more effective on the critical path of driving revenue for their business. But we do it in a very disciplined way that drives margin and cash flow while driving growth. And we talked a lot about Rule of 40 at our FA day. If I were to take a step back and reflect on FY22, it's complicated macro environment, and we\u2019re operating at a rule of 60 for the year. So, we feel really good about our ability to operate. And so as I look forward into next year, we're going to continue to lead. We're going to continue to innovate. We're going to continue to make our customers successful, but we'll continue to do what we've always done, which is ruthlessly prioritized where we make our investments, constantly review the portfolio, prioritize the things that are going to drive long-term value for our customers and do it in a very disciplined way. So, that's the operating tone inside the company. Nothing's changed on that front. We feel really good about how we're executing in the environment and the momentum we're carrying into 2023. From a cash flow standpoint, it all starts with driving that discipline in the business and we'll continue to drive cash flow and deploy that excess cash on a quarterly basis to create value with the shareholders.\nShantanu Narayen: And Alex, given that was the last question, let me start off by saying as we celebrate our 40th anniversary, it's both humbling and inspiring to think about the impact that Adobe has had on the communication world and what we've been able to do. And it's rare to be able to say at this level that we believe that our best years are ahead of us. If I take a step back and I look at what we had done in 2022, there are three things that stand out for me, the Digital Media ARR and just continuing to drive new customer acquisition and deliver innovative products across both, the Creative Cloud and Document Cloud. We've done a really good job of demonstrating why creativity and design is going to be more important and also combining creativity with productivity. On the DX side, the organic creation of the Adobe Experience platform and its apps, and the success that we've seen associated with that, the fact that we just had a first $1 billion quarter as it related to subscription revenues, I think that just reflects both the fact that we created this category. And unlike all of the other enterprise software companies who are in that space, we're just ruthlessly focused on this. And it is unique in that it helps both the top line and bottom line for enterprises. And to the question that you specifically asked, Alex, I mean, profitability, despite the FX impact that impacted hundreds of millions of dollars when you look back and say, at the end of the year, we exceeded our non-GAAP EPS that we had said a year ago/ I think that is a really amazing performance by the finance and operations team of making sure that we continue to remain focused. And I think as it relates to go-forward, we've clearly talked about why we're excited about the innovative road map, why we're excited about all of the things that are going to come up in 2023 and beyond. And so, I think it was a good year. We will continue to remain focused. I want to thank our employees who really are the unsung heroes of all of this execution and the work that they do. And for every one of you, thank you again for your interest in Adobe and happy holidays and wishing you all a joyous holiday season.\nJonathan Vaas: Thanks, everyone. This concludes the call.\nOperator: With that, that does conclude today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "ADBE", "quarter": 3, "year": 2022, "date": "2022-09-15 14:51:04", "content": "Operator: Good day. And welcome to the Q3 FY 2022 Adobe Earnings Conference Call. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Jonathan Vaas, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nJonathan Vaas: Good morning and thank you for joining us. With me on the call today are Shantanu Narayen, Adobe Chairman and CEO; David Wadhwani, President of Digital Media; Anil Chakravarthy, President of Digital Experience; and Dan Durn, Executive Vice President and CFO. On this call, which is being recorded, we will discuss Adobe\u2019s third quarter fiscal year 2022 financial results. You can find our Q3 press release as well as PDF\u2019s of our prepared remarks and financial results on Adobe\u2019s Investor Relations website. The information discussed on this call, including our financial targets and product plans is as of today, September 15th and contains forward-looking statements that involve risk, uncertainty and assumptions. Actual results may differ materially from those set forth in these statements. For a discussion of these risks, you should review the factors discussed in today\u2019s press release and then Adobe\u2019s SEC filings. On this call, we will discuss GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Our reported results include GAAP growth rates, as well as adjusted growth rates in constant currency. During this presentation, Adobe\u2019s executives will refer to constant currency growth rates unless otherwise stated. Reconciliations between the two are available in our earnings release and on Adobe\u2019s Investor Relations website. I will now turn the call over to Shantanu.\nShantanu Narayen: Thanks, Jonathan, and thank you for joining us. Adobe had another record quarter, achieving $4.43 billion in revenue, which represents 15% year-over-year growth. GAAP earnings per share for the quarter was $2.42 and non-GAAP earnings per share was $3.40. In our Digital Media business, we achieved $3.23 billion in revenue. Net new Digital Media annualized recurring revenue or ARR was $449 million and total Digital Media ARR exiting Q3 grew to $13.40 billion. In our Experience Cloud business, we achieved $1.12 billion in revenue and subscription revenue was $981 million. In this digital-first world, Adobe Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and Experience Cloud have become even more mission-critical to an increasingly wide range of customers, from students to creative professionals to small businesses to the world\u2019s largest enterprises. Fueled by our groundbreaking technology, track record of creating and leading categories and consistently strong execution, our opportunity is larger than ever before. Adobe\u2019s greatness has been rooted in defining new categories and platforms and delivering cutting-edge solutions through both organic innovation and inorganic acquisitions. Throughout our history, Adobe\u2019s innovations have touched billions of lives around the globe. From revolutionizing imaging and creative expression with Photoshop, to pioneering electronic documents through PDF, to creating the digital marketing category with Adobe Experience Cloud, Adobe continues to invent and transform categories. We are in the golden age of design and we believe we have a unique opportunity to usher in a new era of collaborative creative computing.  I am thrilled to share that today we announced our intention to acquire Figma, a leading web-first design platform that will help us accelerate this vision. Figma enables designers, developers and all stakeholders to collaborate in the product design process from ideation to design to delivery. The combination of Adobe and Figma will significantly expand our reach and market opportunity while making the creative process more accessible and productive to more people.  I will now turn it over to David to share more about our vision for Adobe and Figma and momentum in the Digital Media business. David?\nDavid Wadhwani: It\u2019s an exciting day for Adobe and Figma. Figma\u2019s mission is to help teams collaborate visually and make design accessible to all. Dylan Field, Figma\u2019s CEO, and his team launched Figma as the first design tool purpose-built for the web in 2012. Figma and FigJam make it possible for all stakeholders designing interactive mobile and web applications to collaborate through multi-player workflows, sophisticated design systems and a rich extensible developer ecosystem. Figma has built an incredible product and an outstanding business, delivering world-class ARR growth and net dollar retention with a disciplined and efficient operating model. Figma has attracted a new generation of millions of designers and developers and a loyal student following. To give you a sense of their scale and financial success, Figma is expected to add approximately $200 million in net new ARR this year, surpassing $400 million in total ARR exiting 2022, with greater than 150% net dollar retention rate. With a total addressable market of $16.5 billion by 2025, Figma is just getting started. Adobe has always been focused on empowering everyone to create digital experiences, and the combination of Adobe and Figma is the perfect better together opportunity. The combination of Adobe and Figma will create new opportunities and accelerate our strategy in a few ways. First, reimagining the future of creativity and productivity, Adobe and Figma share a passion for helping individuals and teams be more creative and productive. Adobe and Figma now have a new opportunity to make content creation more efficient, collaborative and fun by bringing together Adobe Express, Acrobat and FigJam, an online whiteboarding solution for teams. With the combination of these products, we can offer tremendous value to hundreds of millions of customers. Second, accelerating creativity on the web, as creativity becomes increasingly collaborative, the web makes it easier for teams to create together. Figma\u2019s web-based, multi-player platform can accelerate the delivery of Adobe\u2019s Creative Cloud technologies on the web, making the creative process accessible to more people. This will dramatically increase Adobe\u2019s reach and addressable market opportunity. Third, advancing product design, web and mobile applications are increasingly underpinning how we live and work. This is driving explosive growth in the product design category. The combination of Adobe and Figma will benefit all stakeholders in the product design process, from designers to product managers to developers, by bringing powerful capabilities from Adobe\u2019s imaging, photography, illustration, video, 3D and font technologies into the Figma platform over time. And fourth, empowering and expanding the community, throughout our history, Adobe\u2019s community has been a constant source of inspiration and a catalyst for innovation. Figma has a thriving community who develop and share everything from tutorials, templates and plug-ins with their large and growing ecosystem. The combination of our communities will bring designers and developers closer together to unlock the future of collaborative design. Adobe and Figma could not be a better match, our people, innovative technology and joint mission to democratize creativity and collaboration will deliver increased value to a growing base of customers. I look forward to welcoming Dylan and the entire Figma team to Adobe once the transaction closes. The acquisition of Figma could not come at a more exciting time for Adobe\u2019s Digital Media business, which surpassed $13 billion in ARR this quarter, growing 16% year-over-year exiting the quarter. Adobe Creative Cloud remains the world\u2019s creative engine, empowering everyone to create whenever and wherever inspiration strikes. In Q3, we achieved net new Creative Cloud ARR of $330 million and revenue of $2.63 billion, which grew 14% year-over-year. Q3 highlights include; strong momentum for Adobe Express, with significant growth in new users. Adobe Express is serving an expansive universe of creative professionals, communicators and knowledge workers, from students to small business owners to social influencers. It\u2019s exciting to see the rapid innovation we are delivering to enable millions of customers to create standout multimedia content. Adobe Express has thousands of templates, millions of stock assets and quick action functionality that make it easy to do any creative task. Millions of new users are coming to Adobe Express, driven by viral adoption and our creative marketing campaigns. Fast Company recently named Adobe Express one of the best new productivity apps of 2022. Strength in our Photoshop and Lightroom offerings across desktop and mobile, tailwinds in our video segment for Premiere Pro and Frame.io, our integrated video editing and collaboration offering, demand for our Substance products, as brands across every industry embrace 3D and immersive content as a new medium, and momentum in the Adobe Stock business, emphasizing the importance of content velocity for businesses of all sizes. And finally, we are really excited about Adobe MAX, the world\u2019s largest creativity conference. It will be held in Los Angeles and streamed live for our global community. In addition to unveiling amazing new Creative Cloud innovations, we will hear from luminaries including renowned film directors, artists and musicians. Now on to our Document Cloud business. Digital documents are enabling individuals and businesses to be productive in a digital-first world. With more than 300 billion PDFs opened and more than 8 billion digital signatures processed each year, Adobe Document Cloud is accelerating document productivity and workflows across web, desktop and mobile. Document Cloud had its best Q3 ever, achieving net new Document Cloud ARR of $119 million and record revenue of $607 million, which grew 25% year-over-year. Q3 highlights include; continued adoption of PDF across every computing surface, with over 2.6 billion cumulative installs of Acrobat and Reader; significant enhancements to the Acrobat web experience, making popular verbs like view, edit and collaborate easier than ever and adding accessibility capabilities such as Read out Loud and High Contrast support. Acrobat Web MAU continues to see tremendous growth, driven by the high volume of web searches for document actions. Strong growth in Adobe Sign, driven by integrated e-signature functionality in Acrobat; integrated workflows between Acrobat Desktop, Acrobat Web and Adobe Express; and key enterprise customer wins, including Amazon, Boeing, Chubb, Lloyds Bank and ServiceNow. Demand for our industry-leading Digital Media products remains strong across a growing base of customers. We are accelerating momentum across the business with continued product innovation, strong go-to-market capabilities and a proven data-driven operating model. I will now pass it to Anil.\nAnil Chakravarthy: Thanks, David. Hello everyone. One thing has become abundantly clear in this environment, digital has become the critical channel to engage customers and drive growth. Across the globe, companies in every industry are prioritizing investments in software solutions and services that enable them to anticipate and meet the expectations of their consumers. Customer Experience Management is an imperative and Adobe is the category leader. Adobe Experience Cloud delivers predictive, personalized, real-time digital experiences, from acquisition to monetization to retention, across content and commerce, customer journeys, data insights and audiences and marketing workflow. In particular, we are driving strong enterprise adoption of Adobe Experience Platform and Real-Time CDP which are foundational to this next-generation enterprise architecture. FC Bayern, one of the world\u2019s most successful football clubs, is leveraging Adobe Experience Cloud and Real-Time CDP to transform their fan experience. This gives them a holistic view of every fan\u2019s engagement online and offline, enabling them to deliver personalized experiences such as discounts at the stadium or an immersive shopping experience for viewers at home. In Q3, we continued to drive strong Experience Cloud growth, achieving a record $1.12 billion in revenue. Subscription revenue was $981 million for the quarter, representing 15% year-over-year growth. Q3 highlights include; strong momentum for Adobe Experience Platform and AEP-native applications, with the book of business more than doubling year over year; significant growth for Adobe Commerce, underscoring the demand for digital storefronts and marketplaces; Experience Cloud was named a leader for the sixth consecutive year in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Digital Commerce and achieved the highest position in the Forrester Wave for Enterprise Marketing Suites; and key customer wins, including Cr\u00e9dit Agricole, Morgan Stanley, NASA, Qualcomm, T-Mobile and UnitedHealth Group. Looking forward, Adobe is leading an explosive growth category that is increasingly important to enterprises of all sizes. Adobe is well-positioned to help enterprises deliver exceptional customer experiences with industry-leading platforms and applications, a strong track record of deploying solutions successfully for thousands of customers and a proven ability to deliver the next-generation architecture for Customer Experience Management. Dan, over to you.\nDan Durn: Thanks, Anil. Today I will start by summarizing Adobe\u2019s performance in Q3 fiscal 2022, highlighting growth drivers across our businesses, then I will discuss the announced acquisition of Figma and I will finish with financial targets. Adobe delivered a solid Q3, continuing to demonstrate that our products are mission critical to our customer\u2019s success in any macro environment, from the millions of individuals who use our offerings to create digital content, to the small businesses that run their document workflows on Adobe, to the large enterprises that have transformed how they interact with their end users by providing personalization at scale. Q3 business and financial highlights included; record revenue of $4.43 billion; GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.42 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.40; Digital Media revenue of $3.23 billion; net new Digital Media ARR of $449 million; Digital Experience revenue of $1.12 billion; cash flows from operations of $1.70 billion; RPO of $14.11 billion exiting the quarter; and repurchasing approximately 5.1 million shares of our stock during the quarter. In our Digital Media segment, we achieved 13% year-over-year revenue growth in Q3 or 16% in constant currency. We exited the quarter with $13.40 billion of Digital Media ARR. We saw expected summer seasonality in the quarter, with the overall acquisition and engagement environment for our offerings remaining strong. We achieved Creative revenue of $2.63 billion, which represents 11% year-over-year growth or 14% in constant currency. We added $330 million of net new Creative ARR in the quarter. Third quarter Creative growth drivers included; momentum in small and medium businesses with our Teams offering, where we continue to drive strong new customer acquisition and are seeing engagement and retention at all-time highs; strong growth in our Illustrator and InDesign businesses; demand for our flagship photography, imaging and video applications; Adobe Stock where we continue to drive strong book of business growth; and momentum in our new growth initiatives, such as Frame.io and Substance, each of which grew ending ARR greater than 50% year-over-year exiting the quarter. Adobe achieved Document Cloud revenue of $607 million, which represents 23% year-over-year growth or 25% in constant currency. We added $119 million of net new Document Cloud ARR in the quarter, our strongest Q3 to-date. Third quarter Document Cloud growth drivers included; accelerated adoption of PDF and Adobe Reader across multiple surfaces; growth of Acrobat Web, fueled by online searches for PDF and document actions; strong performance of Acrobat and Adobe Sign; performance of our reseller channel continuing to drive new Document Cloud subscriptions, particularly with small and medium businesses; and continued seat expansion in the enterprise. In August we began to roll out the new Acrobat integrated with Sign offering, which included updated pricing. Turning to our Digital Experience segment, in Q3 we achieved revenue of $1.12 billion, which represents 14% year-over-year growth or 15% in constant currency. Digital Experience subscription revenue was $981 million. Third quarter Digital Experience growth drivers included; strong retention, upsell and enterprise bookings in the quarter across our solutions, particularly in the U.S.; success closing numerous million-dollar deals, as well as larger transformational deals that span our portfolio of solutions; continued momentum with our foundational Adobe Experience Platform and Real-Time CDP business, with our book of business for Platform and AEP-native applications more than doubling year-over-year exiting the quarter; success integrating our solutions with workflow, including Workfront, which grew revenue greater than 35% year-over-year in the quarter; and higher customer demand for professional services, as enterprises focus on implementations and value realization. In Q3, we focused on making disciplined investments to drive growth, including a strong class of university hires and marketing campaigns to raise awareness of new and flagship offerings. We continue to have world-class operating margins and drove strong EPS performance in the quarter. Adobe\u2019s effective tax rate in Q3 was 22% on a GAAP basis and 17.5% on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP tax rate came in lower primarily due to benefits associated with share-based payments. The non-GAAP tax rate came in lower primarily due to additional U.S. income tax credits. RPO exiting the quarter was $14.11 billion, growing 12% year-over-year or 15% when factoring in a 3% foreign exchange headwind. Our ending cash and short-term investment position exiting Q3 was $5.76 billion and cash flows from operations in the quarter were $1.70 billion, up 20% year-over-year. In Q3 we repurchased approximately 5.1 million shares at a cost of $1.80 billion, including shares received for the final settlement of our ASR entered into in December 2021. We currently have $8.3 billion remaining of our $15 billion authorization granted in December 2020 which goes through 2024. As Shantanu and David mentioned, we are thrilled about the opportunity to acquire Figma, which will accelerate Adobe\u2019s strategy. Under the definitive agreement, we have agreed to acquire Figma for approximately $20 billion, comprised of approximately half cash and half stock, subject to customary adjustments. Approximately 6 million additional restricted stock units will be granted to Figma\u2019s CEO and employees that will vest over four years subsequent to closing. The transaction is expected to close in 2023, subject to regulatory approvals. We plan to finance the cash portion of the consideration with cash on hand, and if necessary, a term loan, to be paid down from our operating cash flows following the closing. Figma\u2019s products address a $16.5 billion market opportunity and the company has an impressive financial profile. This year they are expected to add $200 million in net new ARR, surpassing $400 million total ARR by the end of the year, with greater than 150% net dollar retention. They have a disciplined, efficient operating model, with gross margins of approximately 90% and positive operating cash flows. Figma have strong business momentum, a large and expanding customer base and we are incredibly excited about what we can bring to this combination from a financial perspective. While this transaction is primarily about creating new markets, expanding adjacent opportunities and accelerating growth, we are committed to maintaining Adobe\u2019s strong profitability and maximizing EPS for our investors. In year one and two after closing, the transaction will be dilutive to Adobe\u2019s non-GAAP EPS and we expect it to be breakeven in year three and accretive at the end of year three. While the transaction has not yet closed, I want to provide color on the path to non-GAAP EPS accretion as a combined company exiting year three, assuming Adobe\u2019s operating margin for the second half of fiscal 2022 as the baseline. The combination will accelerate top-line growth for both Adobe and Figma based on three primary drivers; one, we extend Figma\u2019s reach to our customers and through our global go-to-market footprint; two, Figma accelerates the delivery of new Adobe offerings on the web to the next generation of users; and three, we jointly introduce new offerings to market as we unlock the possibilities of collaborative creativity. Clearly the explosive revenue growth of Figma combined with their efficient operating model would result in an expanding standalone operating margin. Figma\u2019s innovative technology platform will accelerate our R&D roadmap including the delivery of our Creative Cloud technologies on the web, which will allow Adobe to focus and manage our future R&D investments. We will quickly pay down any term loan, if necessary, after close and then resume stock repurchases to reduce Adobe\u2019s share count. While the transaction is pending, at a minimum we expect to maintain share repurchases sufficient to offset the dilution of equity issuances to Adobe employees. We will now provide Q4 targets, which factor in the overall macroeconomic environment; FX headwinds, as the U.S. dollar has continued to strengthen against foreign currencies; and typical year-end seasonal strength in demand for our offerings. As a result, for Q4 we are targeting; total Adobe revenue of approximately $4.52 billion; net new Digital Media ARR of approximately $550 million; Digital Media segment revenue growth of approximately 10% year-over-year or 14% in constant currency; Digital Experience segment revenue growth of approximately 13% year-over-year or 15% in constant currency; Digital Experience subscription revenue growth of approximately 13% year-over-year or 15% in constant currency; tax rate of approximately 23% on a GAAP basis and 17.5% on a non-GAAP basis; and GAAP earnings per share of approximately $2.44 and non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $3.50. In summary, Adobe continues to drive performance across Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and Experience Cloud, while making transformational investments in strategic growth initiatives. I look forward to sharing more about our growth opportunities next month in Los Angeles at Adobe\u2019s Financial Analyst meeting. Shantanu, back to you.\nShantanu Narayen: Thanks, Dan. It was great to be back on the road this quarter meeting customers and partners as businesses return to a new hybrid work model. I was inspired and energized welcoming our new hires and meeting Adobe employees across multiple sites who will together drive the next phase of innovation, growth and culture. Adobe\u2019s strength has always come from our most important asset, people. I am incredibly proud of the recognition we continue to receive as a great place to work. This quarter, Adobe was named to Fast Company\u2019s Best Workplace for Innovators and Fortune\u2019s Best Workplaces in Tech. Next week, we will hold our Adobe for All conference to bring employees together to celebrate our shared values of diversity, equity and inclusion. It is an exciting time at Adobe. Our strategy to unleash creativity for all, accelerate document productivity and power digital businesses is working. We are delivering on our innovative product roadmap, driving growth across new and established businesses and delighting a growing universe of customers. In addition to achieving all this success, we continue to look around the corner for new transformational opportunities that will drive decades of growth for Adobe. We believe that every individual, team and business will strive to be more creative and productive in this digital era. Adobe has a unique opportunity to usher in a world of collaborative creativity. In my conversations with Dylan at Figma, it became abundantly clear that together we could accelerate this new vision, delivering great value to our customers and shareholders. I look forward to welcoming Figma into the Adobe family upon close of the transaction. We look forward to seeing you at MAX and closing the year strong. Now, we will take questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from a Kash Rangan of Goldman Sachs.\nKash Rangan: Hello. Thank you very much. Congratulations on really massive step forward to the management team. Shantanu and team, I wonder if you can talk about the persona of Figma and if there is any overlap at all between what Adobe wanted to be in the future with its a Creative family and where Figma is growing -- was going, and if you net it out, what is the incremental opportunity. It looks like $16 billion TAM, but your own Creative business, you outline as having a more than a $40 billion TAM. So I am wondering what the TAM could look like for Figma in the future as it integrates into Adobe, you identify new personas. And for Dan three years to breakeven, it sounds like there are some conservative assumptions built in especially because Figma is generating cash. I am wondering what your assumptions are for that the rather lengthy duration to breakeven. Thank you so much and congrats.\nShantanu Narayen: Thanks, Kash, and congratulations to you as well for the conference that is happening right now and given our quiet period as you know we can\u2019t attend. But let me take a step back and talk about why we believe this is a fundamentally transformative move for Adobe. When we think about the future of what\u2019s happening with creativity, and in a sense, what\u2019s going to happen as it relates to multiple people engaging in that with respect to collaboration, we just believe that this is going to be an incredible value and a way to attract a whole bunch of new customers to the combined platform. When you think about Adobe, certainly we target knowledge workers, we target communicators, we target creative professionals. Figma really focuses a lot also on developers, they focus very much on the other stakeholders, who are involved in the product design process. So when we talk about the fact that Figma has a $16 billion TAM, that\u2019s referring to the TAM as it exist today, in terms of what they are doing, both as it relates to product design, as well as that would relates to collaborative whiteboarding and ideation, which as you know, say, FigJam this incredible product that has, I believe, a much, much larger available addressable opportunity. But if you take a really what we think is the massive opportunity and putting this together. I think there are four aspects that are really exciting for us. First, there is going to be a next-generation of Creative collaboration that happens in the industry, and we believe that the combination of the two companies enable us to really position Adobe and deliver great value for this Creative collaboration industry. Second, we continue to believe that we can accelerate what it means to create on the web. What Figma has done is they have delivered a really incredible technology platform and solved the number of the issues that need to be solved to allow multiple people to collaborate on the web. Third, we think that we can advance product design and if you take the decades of Adobe technology that exists, our imaging technology, our vector technology, the video technology that we have and think about what that means to bring that to the web and dramatically increase the number of customers who can then benefit from it. And last but not least, I think, to your question. This is now really addresses that sort of Holy Grail of anybody creating a mobile application, anybody creating a website, anybody creating an application for any device that has a screen, combining what we can do on the designers, developers and the stakeholders to make that happen. So I think today, what we shared with you is what they talk about as their addressable market opportunity, what we talk about as ours. But I think the real benefit of this combination is creating brand new markets, much like we have done with Digital Experience and other industries that we are part of. So thank you and we are really excited about this.\nDan Durn: Yeah. Then from an accretion standpoint, first and foremost, this deal is about growth. This is about positioning the company to define new categories and drive growth for decades to come. And as we think about that growth trajectory, walked into -- walked through a number of those drivers. It\u2019s about extending the performance of that platform as part of the combined company, getting it access to our customers and our go-to-market global -- go-to-market footprint. It\u2019s about accelerating the delivery of new Adobe offerings on the web and then jointly introduce new offerings as we unlock those possibilities in collaborative creativity. This gives us an opportunity to focus and manage the R&D investments as we drive that roadmap and striking the balance between accelerating the growth and preserving that growth trajectory, but doing it in a disciplined way. We are going to deliver a tremendous amount of value over time to investors. Starting in year two post close, you will see our EPS growth rate faster than our overall revenue growth, will be accretive exiting year three and we are poised to deliver a lot of value.\nKash Rangan: Wonderful. Thank you so much and best wishes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brad Zelnick of Deutsche Bank.\nBrad Zelnick: Thank you very much and congratulations. This is obviously a big moment for Adobe. It\u2019s pretty clear what Figma brings to the table in terms of innovation, collaboration and communities, and I appreciate the comments about Figma helping to further webify core Adobe products. But what do you say to the perspective that this $20 billion acquisition seems more reactive versus proactive? And perhaps more importantly, how do we get comfortable that Adobe\u2019s organic innovation engine is alive and well for capturing the trends and opportunities that lie ahead in Creative?\nShantanu Narayen: Brad, it\u2019s a good question and I understand that in these markets, in particular, acquisitions and maybe large ones are viewed with some skepticism. We certainly believe and I will talk about it that Figma will be a transformative deal for the customers and industries and it dramatically increases our TAM. We can deliver great value to an increasing set of customers. But I also want to reassure all of you and if you look at our results, this in no way changes our focus or our excitement on our current portfolio. We are growing well, and we are demonstrating strength across all of our three cloud offerings and we continue to execute against our current initiatives. And so if you look at the multiple internal businesses that are achieving velocity, whether it\u2019s Adobe Experience platform and the apps that are built natively on top of it, what\u2019s happening with 3D and immersive, what\u2019s happening with Acrobat Forms, what\u2019s happening with Frame. This is additive. And when opportunities like this present themselves, Brad, I think it\u2019s the great companies that look at it and say, are you going to focus on the here and now only or are you going to seize on the opportunity that really positions Adobe for the next few decades. And so it\u2019s a great question. We understand that there will be questions associated with valuation. We certainly believe that it provides valuation to our shareholders as well. When you look at what this means for us, but in no way diminishes my excitement around our current portfolio.\nBrad Zelnick: Very fair. Thank you and look forward to seeing it all on display at MAX next month. Thanks, guys. Congrats.\nShantanu Narayen: Thank you, Brad.\nOperator: We can go to Alex Zukin of Wolfe Research.\nAlex Zukin: Hey, guys. So I will start with a non-Figma question and then layer in Figma. I guess, Shantanu, can you talk, or David, can you guys give us the kind of lay of the land on the demand environment, how it trended throughout the quarter, obviously, a lot of companies are seeing some elongation of deal cycles, descoping, even our channel checks on the Digital Experience side suggested that their deals are taking longer to close as they are requiring a lot more signatures. So, I guess, first of all, what are you seeing in the demand environment and what are -- because one of the questions we are getting from investors is why now, given that we may be entering a more recessionary environment, couldn\u2019t you have done this type of a transaction cheaper later, so that\u2019s kind of how I want to weave this in?\nShantanu Narayen: Yeah. Let me address the first part, which was your second part of the question, which is why now. Again, and as I said, we just believe that this new vision that we can create for, what we can do with collaborative creativity, there\u2019s no time like the present to start working on top of it. And when opportunities like this present themselves, you have to act upon it rather than kicking that can down the road, Alex. So, from my perspective, we know how to make this deliver great value to our customers. I will have David also speak to the demand environment and the Creative side. On the Enterprise side, as we said, we had strong results. I mean the AEP plus apps business, that book of business is doubling, which really reflects the foundational aspects of what we are delivering. But it -- again, I go back to -- opportunities like this present themselves rarely and Figma is one of those rare companies that has achieved the kind of escape velocity and technology platform that they have. But we equally believe that it\u2019s even rarer for a company like Adobe to be able to take advantage of what they deliver and actually accelerate it and provide greater value and so from my perspective, there\u2019s no time like the present.\nDavid Wadhwani: Yeah. And on the Digital Media side, we began the year with a guide of $1.9 billion, and of course, we hope to beat that. And in the context of everything happening in the macro, if you look at Q1, Q2, Q3 and our guide for Q4, we are at $1.88 billion and in the context of everything happening in the world, we are very proud of this performance. And of course, we are an aggressive company. We hope to beat that number. And all the leading indicators remained strong. New user acquisition is strong, engagement and retention continues to be strong, monthly active users continue to be strong. And so we feel really good about the macro -- about our ability to navigate the macro despite what\u2019s happening in the world around us. And then in the context of as we start looking for opportunities to grow, we have so much product innovation coming out at -- and we will see a lot of it at MAX, accelerating what\u2019s happening in our flagship applications, what\u2019s happening around Express and the kinds of capabilities we are putting in there. We are seeing great growth and momentum in terms of use and NPS there, Photoshop and Illustrator coming to the web. We have a lot of share for review collaborative capabilities coming as well. And then as you look at the conversation around Figma, we have known Dylan for years and we have shared very common values and vision, and the opportunities to grow that business faster and the synergies we have in mind are -- just allow us to take what is already a strong business and make it even stronger and faster.\nAlex Zukin: Perfect. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: The next question is from Brent Thill of Jefferies.\nBrent Thill: Shan, you -- everyone\u2019s admired your ability to stay disciplined on M&A over the last decade and I guess many are kind of feeling like you broke the mold on this, and I think, everyone just wants to hear on the multiple, even if revenue doubled again, it would be over 25 times ARR. So what was it that was so special, and if you think about in the last few years, you have always said XD could carry you, why -- what happened with XD, what happens with XD now as it scales?\nShantanu Narayen: So two things to that, Brent. The first is, I understand that what you are saying in effect is some people will say, hey, show me how this value is accruing to Adobe shareholders as well and we certainly believe that otherwise we wouldn\u2019t be doing it and we do believe that it will be value-generating for the Adobe shareholders. I think as it relates to XD and as it relates to Figma, I mean, we certainly, for designers, we are targeting what needed to happen as it related to screen design with the desktop product. I think the much newer market that emerged, which Figma effectively both addressed and pioneered was the ability to do this in a collaborative way and dramatically increase the scale, and they over the last decade, have really invested in and solve some of the hard technical problems that existed to make this happen on the web friction-free. So from our perspective, the Creative products continue to be strong, the ability to really tie the designers and developers is really where there\u2019s this unique opportunity, as well as to create new markets. I mean I will give you one more sort of what-if scenario in terms of how we think about it, which is you combine what they have done with whiteboarding and ideation, and what will be the future of work, and if you think about the presence of Acrobat and what we have with Acrobat or if you think about the notion of brainstorming and what happens with FigJam, with what happens with Adobe Express, I think the opportunities are tremendous. I understand that there will be some sentiment associated with the price, and ball\u2019s in our court to go demonstrate how we execute against our current initiatives, as well as to demonstrate the value of this new one.\nBrent Thill: Thanks, Shantanu.\nOperator: We can go to Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley.\nKeith Weiss: Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question. One just a real brief one on Figma, I don\u2019t want to beat that horse too much and then some questions on the core business. On Figma, we have definitely heard a lot about them in the field and it\u2019s a great asset you guys are acquiring. It does seem like it overlaps pretty directly with InDesign. So can you talk a little bit about sort of the -- is there a rationalization of those two products or is Figma just kind of the go-forward product there? And then on the core business, last week -- not last week, last quarter you gave us a little bit of an update on kind of how pricing was impacted -- impacting Digital Media and net new ARR. I was hoping to get an update on sort of how the pricing impact flow through this quarter. And then on the margin front, it looks like you guys pulled back on hiring a little bit, can you talk to us about the pace of investments on a go-forward basis and whether that\u2019s going to be a little bit more measured given the macro impact starting to build up? Thank you very much.\nDavid Wadhwani: Yeah. I will start by talking about InDesign and Figma. They are very different products at the core. InDesign is around building print and publishing workflows and doing layout. Figma is really all about enabling product design and a collaborative product design model. In fact, if you look at InDesign, it\u2019s our traditional base of users, predominantly designers that are using it. One of the things that\u2019s really interesting about Figma is the makeup of their user base. In fact, two-thirds of their users are not designers, they are developers and other stakeholders in the process, and the foundation of that collaborative model is what makes this such a special and accretive acquisition for us. If you think about going forward, the primary focus is going to be about bringing Figma into the family and then taking all of the capabilities we have across illustration and video and creative imaging and building it on top of the Figma platform to enable a whole new generation of capabilities that are going to resonate with digital native and next-generation creative professionals, and we are very excited about them. The two products are quite different.\nDan Durn: Yeah. Then from an investment standpoint, one of the great things about Adobe is, is we have got tremendous growth opportunities. We have got an opportunity to drive the core franchise to $30 billion to $40 billion of revenue. But we are going to do what we have always done, which is invest in a disciplined way and drive that growth with strong profitability and strong cash flow and so we will do what we have always done. We are going to orient towards growth. We are back utilizing our facilities. We are investing to scale our business. We are investing in our products, go-to-market marketing. We are driving PLG motions, but we are going to do it in a disciplined way that delivers strong profitability and cash flow, while growing this business in a strong and robust way. So we will do what we have always done, operating a disciplined business.\nKeith Weiss: Got it. And on the pricing side?\nDavid Wadhwani: Yeah. On the pricing side, first of all, pricing for us is all about value. The business that we have been building is all based on new user acquisition, upselling, and of course, occasionally pricing moves and the pricing is always associated with added value. So on the Creative side we have been adding lots of apps. We have been enabling Frame.io integration into Creative -- into our Creative Cloud applications. We have been building a lot of share and review workflows, as an example, a lot of stock and content images in there as well and then on the Acrobat Pro side, we have been doing a lot more deep integration with Sign around bulk signatures, branding, web forms payments. So the foundation is that pricing is always connected to the real value that we are adding, and in doing that, we continue to see pricing play out the way we expected and all of this was baked into what we had planned for the year.\nOperator: Next question comes from Brad Sills of Bank of America Securities.\nBrad Sills: Oh! Great. Thanks so much. Another question here on Figma, it looks like the company is well positioned for designer, developer use cases, much like Frame.io for video editing, bringing you into more of those use cases really extending the reach for Creative Cloud. I guess the question is, where does Creative Cloud end up, where does that footprint end and the Figma footprint began? In other words, could you see a scenario where this acquisition and these use cases bring through -- pull-through more sales of Creative Cloud subscriptions?\nShantanu Narayen: I think the three ways in which we look at that. First, in terms of the customers for Figma, I think, as David mentioned, the number of developers who are part of this products set is actually extremely extensive. But in addition to the product set associated with Figma design for developers, as well as stakeholders, I do want to again emphasize the product fit as it relates to FigJam for anybody who\u2019s a knowledge worker and anybody who wants to ideate. So if you think about the value of ideation and brainstorming. I mean the reality is, they have tens of millions of people who signed up and trialed Figma. We have hundreds of millions of people who have used our products and so the adjacency in terms of enabling both of those combined sets of customers to use each other\u2019s products, we continue to believe that drives great value. So this is really about, in our sense and then if you take Acrobat and the penetration that Acrobat has, everybody who\u2019s using Acrobat also wants to both share, as well as ideate and brainstorm. So I know there\u2019s a lot of questions around Figma design, which is clearly achieved escape velocity. I would urge you also to spend a little time looking at FigJam as I know you have and then you would really understand that, that also dramatically expands the customer base. So, yes, getting Creative Cloud to a more diverse set of customers on the web, allowing collaboration and enabling it much like you said with Frame. That\u2019s very much part of the strategy and that\u2019s why even in the press release, we talk about accelerating creativity on the web as one of the key pillars.\nBrad Sills: Thanks so much, Shantanu. Dan, one for you, please, if I could, you have talked about in the past some healthy pipeline build for Q4 backing your confidence for Digital Media ARR guidance based on some good pipeline activity there for Q4, any update on that, please? Thank you.\nDan Durn: Yeah. No. It\u2019s playing out as we expected as we take a look at the enterprise business, closing million dollar plus deals, transformational deals as we look forward off of that momentum into Q4. Pipeline is building nicely. Team is doing a good job executing against the opportunity and it\u2019s playing out as expected.\nBrad Sills: Thank you so much.\nOperator: The next question is from Jay Vleeschhouwer of Griffin Securities.\nJay Vleeschhouwer: Thank you. Good morning. Shantanu, in some of your remarks and Dan in one of your bullet points regarding the rationale for Figma, you made some interesting references to their platform and accelerating your products on the Cloud. Are you suggesting perhaps that there\u2019s something in their DevOps, let\u2019s call it, that may lead ultimately to a material change in Adobe\u2019s product release cadence or product packaging? How do you see your portfolio evolving and your underlying R&D, let\u2019s call it, infrastructure or process, because there\u2019s something into in terms of how they develop products that I think you are hoping to splice in that kind of DNA? And then, secondly, it\u2019s not unprecedented for Adobe to purchase a dynamic competitor, we can go back many years, we have done this before. Maybe put this into context of some of those prior acquisitions where you bought a competitor that had meaningful either competitive impact or complementary technology and thinking, of course, about the material impact that the Macromedia acquisition had many years ago.\nShantanu Narayen: So, Jay, let me first cover the first one and there\u2019s no doubt that what Figma has been able to do on the web by solving a lot of these multiplayer high scalability requirements to allow the tens of millions of people to use Figma design and even more important FigJam on the web, is an engineering marvel. And having access to that technology and being able to take advantage of it to dramatically increase anybody who\u2019s participating in our design products, whether they would be stakeholders and developers will, I think, dramatically increase our TAM as well. And so, first and foremost, their DevOps is great. I mean we certainly have a lot of that expertise on the Digital Experience side of the house as it relates to the trillions of transactions. But for the Creative, we really believe that this is one of the key pieces of technology that we are getting that are going to be really amazing. I think as it relates to your second question, we really view these as, when you have the right altitude, for us it\u2019s all about how do you take things that might seem competitive, but are actually more complementary and expand the nature of the market. And for me, when I think about what we did with Macromedia, it was really about saying. We are going to target more graphics professionals and not just focus on imaging. We are going to focus on what\u2019s happening with video on the web or gaming. And so I think it was an expansive part of how we looked at it. And that\u2019s the same situation here. For us, it\u2019s really not about what we had on the desktop. It\u2019s really about expanding to the web. Multi-surface is something that we have talked about a lot. It\u2019s about a community in many ways, Jay, and what they have done as it relates to their communities and plug-ins and how they have been able to use artificial intelligence, all of that also power we bring to bear to the combined. So from my perspective, this is really about adjacency. It\u2019s about complementary things that we have done. Certainly, we did have a presence in screen design on the desktop. But big picture this is all about dramatically expanding it and that\u2019s the conversation that David, Dylan, Scott and I have been having. And David, feel free to add to that.\nDavid Wadhwani: Yeah. From the beginning of the conversations with Dylan, the primary focus has been on things that we couldn\u2019t do individually. What are the things that we could do and bring to market that combining the two products and put -- two product sets into two companies could really enable a better-together story. And in particular, what we see is that we have this incredible wealth of technology and expertise around illustration and video and imaging and photography and 3D, all from -- coming from the lens of our flagship applications, and as Shantanu mentioned, they have built such a rich platform for collaboration. Bringing these things together allow us to re-imagine what the -- basically Creative -- content creation should look like in the future by taking our technology, integrating it on top of or building it on top of the Figma platform and then enabling a whole set of new use cases that would never have happened were it not for this combination.\nJay Vleeschhouwer: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Saket Kalia of Barclays.\nSaket Kalia: Okay. Great. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question and congrats to all on the announcement. Dan, maybe for you, just to maybe focus on the core business for a minute and then loop in Figma. Are there any puts and takes with margins this year that we should keep in mind when thinking about organic margins next year, and of course, I understand you are guiding to it, but just sort of anything that you want us to note? And then on top of that, how do you think about the EBIT profitability for Figma and where that can go over time?\nDan Durn: Sure. So let me take them in order. So as we think about our margins this year, I think, you can see the trajectory throughout the year. What I would say is what we are seeing in the back half of 2022, I think, is more reflective of the normalized environment. We talked about continuing to invest in the products, how we market those products, how we drive product led growth, how we are going to market. But also complementing it with repopulating the campuses, being back to in-person interaction, getting on planes and that\u2019s a bit more reflective of a normalized operating environment. So that\u2019s what I would say, think about maybe the second half of 2022 as a bit more of a normalized environment. As we think about margins in the context of Figma and the transaction, we talked a couple -- about a couple of things. We talked about this is about growth. This is delivering that growth in a disciplined way. So when I think about operating margins in that context, we talked about the second half of 2022 being that baseline more normalized run rate. And if I think about the first couple of years post close, year one, year two post close. Think about margins that are maybe 1 point to 2 points delta versus where we would be on a standalone basis. And then by the time we get to year three, I would expect it to be more neutral from an influence standpoint. And again, I also want to register the point that I mentioned earlier in Q&A. As we get past year one, we are going to start growing EPS faster than our revenue growth profile and so we feel good about that inflection point and driving it in a disciplined way. When we look at GAAP operating margins, obviously, you will see a bigger delta in the near-term. To account for the stock-based compensation, we really view that stock-based compensation to incentivize the employees to stay with the company and unlock those growth potentials and you will see that amortize over a four-year period consistent with our equity programs and then we will be back to a more normalized run rate after that amortization period. So you will see more impact on the GAAP side and we feel pretty good about the trajectory from a non-GAAP operating margin standpoint.\nSaket Kalia: Very, very helpful. Thanks, Dan. Congrats again.\nDan Durn: Thanks.\nJonathan Vaas: Hey, Operator. We are coming up on the top of the hour. Let\u2019s try to squeeze in two more questions please.\nOperator: Certainly. We can go straight to Phil Winslow of Credit Suisse.\nPhil Winslow: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to focus on a little bit more in the near-term in terms of your guidance for Q4. If we were in back to last year, you saw sort of a lower uplift around sort of the Black Friday selling period as compared to prior years. Now, obviously, going into this Q4 is always is you are a seasonally stronger business or enterprise spend period for Adobe, we are also going into that sort of that Black Friday period again, obviously. When you think about your guidance for Q4, what are you baking in compared to last year for sort of those Black Friday trends, but also that sort of seasonal uplift in the business spending?\nShantanu Narayen: I think as we said in our prepared remarks, Phil, we are guiding in typical seasonality, Q4 tends to be a strong season both in terms of the enterprise business for us and closing the enterprise business and the pipeline that we have built over the year, as well as some consumer commerce days, as you mentioned and all of that is factored into the targets that we are guiding. We are not changing that based on anything different than we have seen. So I think we continue to believe that our business is resilient and if you look at the initial targets that we are providing, we would expect to have another strong seasonal close to the year.\nPhil Winslow: Great. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: And the final question today comes from Kirk Materne of Evercore ISI.\nKirk Materne: Hi. Thanks very much and congrats on the acquisition. Dan, I just wanted to follow up on your comments maybe on the dilution around the deal. I think just based on what Shantanu and all of you have said about sort of the complementary nature of the deal, the ability to expand the market. I think people are asking why isn\u2019t there more sort of synergy from a go-to-market perspective with this deal, meaning bringing Figma onto your platform would theoretically just turbocharge sales immediately given sort of your scale? So I just -- how much of that\u2019s baked into the dilution forecast or are you -- I realize it\u2019s early, but are you leaving that more for upside, because I think the length of the dilution given that this should be complementary from a go-to-market perspective, I think, is what\u2019s somewhat confusing to folks? Thanks.\nShantanu Narayen: Well, certainly, for us, this is all about the top line growth and what -- if you look at actually what we would expect in terms of their continued growth and our continued growth, I think, the topline of both companies they would accelerate. And so I think maybe at the FA meeting, as we get more time, we are happy to share more color associated with it. But from my perspective, we actually think that we have a plan that allows us to really show the benefits of the combination, as well as continue to overachieve against those.\nKirk Materne: Okay.\nShantanu Narayen: And since that is the\u2026\nKirk Materne: Yeah.\nShantanu Narayen: Go ahead.\nKirk Materne: Just a follow-up on that. I just -- too difficult for us to, meaning you both can grow faster, are these new developers that require sort of new efforts to go get them from Adobe perspective. I am just trying to get a sense of the overlap of the opportunity would seemingly think that you guys combined could actually do it more effectively together, which would create greater operating leverage to a certain degree sooner. So I am just trying to -- I realize there\u2019s a lot of moving parts in the near term to this, but I was just kind of curious, is that what\u2019s sort of embedded in your expectations or are you sort of leaving that for to see what happens as you get, I guess, a little bit closer to the deal closing?\nShantanu Narayen: I think for us, we are just factoring in everything, including the fact that this is a stock purchase and half of it is approximately in stock and what that means in terms of dilution. As we said, we will start to offset that. We have tremendous cash flow generation. But from our perspective, we are going to be aggressive about making sure that we continue to drive the topline and the bottomline. And so that is very much on our mind in terms of delivering great value to the customers in the industry and creating new opportunities. And from my perspective, what I do want to say, since that was the last question was, first and foremost, we are really excited about our current business. I mean the current business is growing at a great clip in this macroeconomic environment. We have multiple growth initiatives that are all demonstrating how mission-critical they are and how they are relevant they are in this new digital-first world where whether it\u2019s work, life, play, everything is going to be impacted by digital. So, first and foremost, we are very confident about our existing portfolio and the growth trajectory of the current portfolio. The addition of Figma, from my perspective, is the ability to turbocharge that in terms of both the opportunity that the company has, as well as the ability to serve ever broadening set of customers. And so I hope you all view that within that context, which is lot of confidence about our existing business and more excitement about making sure that we are setting in place greater future opportunities. We will look forward to having a lot of you at MAX. I hope you do come there. We are planning an FA part of that section as well and so we would be happy to share more with you when we join that. And with that, I will turn it over to Jonathan.\nJonathan Vaas: Thanks, Shantanu, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. This concludes the call."}, {"symbol": "ADBE", "quarter": 2, "year": 2022, "date": "2022-06-16 20:55:07", "content": "Operator: Good day and welcome to the Q2 FY 2022 Adobe Earnings Conference Call.

In my conversations around the world, it is clear that Digital is playing a pivotal role in powering the economy and enabling the world to keep moving forward. I will now turn it over to David to share more about our momentum in the Digital Media business. David?\nDavid Wadhwani: Thanks, Shantanu, and hello everyone. Adobe products have always been the solution of choice for the world's creators, whether they're designers, photographers, filmmakers, or illustrators. Today, the explosion of the creator economy is enabling even more individuals, solopreneurs and small business owners to express themselves in creative ways. Whether it's a hobby, a side hustle, or a full time job, every creator and business is reimagining how they build their brand and engage their audiences in a digital first world, underscoring the rapidly growing demand for content and creativity. Adobe Creative Cloud offers the most comprehensive portfolio of products and services across every creative category, including imaging, photography, design, video, and 3D and immersive. We continue to invest across our core flagship products, including a heavy dose of new AI features. As demand for content increases, content creators are looking to Adobe to help them work together efficiently. We're responding by integrating collaboration capabilities directly into our flagship applications that enable creative teams to collaborate with each other, and with stakeholders. As communicators have become a growing part of our creative cloud customer base, we've expanded our offerings to include Adobe Express; our new template based easy-to-use web and mobile product. Express creates an opportunity to serve a broader base of communicators who need lightweight task based tools to create everything from social media posts, logos and flyers for their small businesses, to party invitations and posters for their personal needs. Real Estate entrepreneur Chrishell Stause is a great example of a social media influencer, who is leveraging Adobe Express to transform how she markets her properties and engages her followers. She is one of millions of users promoting their products and services with Adobe Express. In Q2, we achieve net new creative cloud ARR of $357 million and revenue of $2.61 billion, which grew 14% year-over-year. Q2 highlights include continued innovation in the imaging category. This quarter, we launched powerful new capabilities in Photoshop, including Photo Restoration neural filter that detects and restores damaged photos in seconds. Neural filters are one of Photoshops most used AI powered features. They have now been used by millions of users and apply it to hundreds of millions of images. We're also delivering enhancements to Photoshop on the web, including new editing features, support for mobile browsers and integrated learning content. Video Production also continues to explode, and Premiere Pro remains a leader in video creation, editing, and now collaboration with Frame.io. The new integration between Frame and Premiere Pro and After Effects is streamlining review and collaboration workflows across stakeholders. Frame had another strong quarter with new customer wins including Epic Games and NBCUniversal which are using it to manage their video content supply chain something that Anil will talk more about in a few minutes. We're also seeing the emergence of new categories like 3D as customer demand for metaverse ready content continues to increase. Substance 3D had its strongest Q2 ever as customers like Hugo Boss, Mattel, and Unity rely on it to deliver immersive experiences across fashion, gaming and e-commerce. We continue to rapidly innovate in this space, including delivering native Apple hardware support for painter, designer and sampler enabling creators to work faster than ever before. The Substance team also delivered a new SDK for developers who want to integrate 3D capabilities into their applications. And finally, we're excited about the momentum we're seeing for Adobe Express with millions of monthly active users and strong growth in traffic and new users in Q2. We continue to bring the magic of Photoshop imaging Premier Video and Acrobat PDF capabilities like background removal, QR code generation, video resizing, and PDF editing to Express, and we released our new content scheduler feature thanks to our recent acquisition of ContentCal, allowing creators to quickly create, preview, schedule and publish social media content. We're also excited to kick off our \u201cExpress Your Brand Partnership\u201d with Meta, which will enable over 200 million businesses to grow their online presence using Adobe Express. And our product led growth strategy allows us to use millions of data points to continuously test, learn and optimize the entire Express experience from search to export. Adobe Express recently received the Editor's Choice Award on the App Store, recognizing top apps for design, functionality and performance. We're very excited about the strong demand for Creative Cloud offerings globally driven by acquisition, engagement and retention from our data driven operating model across individuals, SMBs and Enterprises. Key enterprise customer wins include Activision, Bertelsmann, Hasbro, Honda Motor, Daimler AG, and CSOFT, Services Australia, State of California and WPP. In our Document Cloud business, digital document workflows are automating manual paper processes across our personal and professional lives. Whether it's a legal contract, invoice, or school permission slip, we now need to scan, edit, share and sign from anywhere. Adobe Document Cloud offers the most comprehensive intuitive tools for document productivity across every device and platform. In education, the University of East London is adopting Document Cloud to manage workflows for enrolling 17,000 students from 135 countries. In financial services, TSB Bank is transforming the online banking experience by enabling customers to quickly and securely complete common tasks like loan applications that could previously only be done in branches. In Q2, we achieved net new Document Cloud ARR of $107 million and record revenue of $595 million, which grew 28% year-over-year. Q2 highlights include strong growth in monthly active users across desktop, mobile and web. The rising volume of search traffic for Acrobat verbs remains a productive funnel to Acrobat web, which surpassed 50 million monthly active users in Q2 more than doubling year-over-year. Mobile App momentum remains strong with billions of PDFs opened in Acrobat mobile, and hundreds of millions of cumulative Adobe scan installs. Acrobat and Adobe sign integration continues to drive strong demand for Adobe sign as users increasingly send PDFs for signature directly from the unified Acrobat experience. Acrobat and Adobe Express integrations now give hundreds of millions of Acrobat users the ability to embed customized templates and make their PDFs visually stunning. And Acrobat and Sign API's are thriving as customers increasingly customize, integrate and automate document services. We're thrilled with the momentum we see in the Acrobat ecosystem, and our business performance across routes to market and customer segments, including key enterprise customer wins with automatic data processing, Duke Energy, Quanta services and U.S. Bank. We continue to see strong demand for our products in the second half of FY 2022 will continue to win in the digital media business through product innovation across Creative Cloud and Document Cloud, which are targeting a broad growing base of customers. Our tremendous scale, consistent marketing investments, proven data driven operating model and new product lead growth initiatives are accelerating our momentum across our new and established businesses. I'll now pass it to Anil.\nAnil Chakravarthy: Thanks, David. Hello, everyone. Even in this uncertain economy, every business continues to prioritize its digital investment.

Dan, over to you.\nDan Durn: Thanks, Anil. Today, I will start by summarizing Adobe\u2019s performance in Q2 fiscal 2022, highlighting growth drivers across our businesses, and I\u2019ll finish with targets. Adobe delivered a strong quarter, surpassing our issued Q2 financial targets in an uncertain macro environment. On the top line, we grew revenue by 14% year-over-year, or 15% in constant currency, while making long term growth investments, we delivered operating margins of 35% on a GAAP basis and 45% on a non-GAAP basis continuing to be one of the most predictable and profitable growth companies in technology  We have three strategic businesses growing into massive addressable markets, with differentiated products used by hundreds of millions of individuals every month. In addition to our established businesses, we are delivering innovations and new offerings that will drive transformational growth in the future. Q2 business and financial highlights included record revenue of $4.39 billion, GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.49 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.35. Digital Media revenue of $3.02 billion net new Digital Media ARR of $464 million. Digital Experience revenue of $1.10 billion cash flows from operations of $2.04 billion. RPO of $13.82 billion exiting the quarter, and repurchasing approximately 1.9 million shares of our stock during the [Technical difficulty] 15% year-over-year revenue growth in constant [ph] currency. We exited the quarter with 12.95 billion of Digital Media ARR. We achieved creative revenue of $2.61 billion which represents 12% year-over-year growth or 14% in constant currency. We added $357 million of net New Creative ARR in the quarter, a sequential increase of 13% from Q1. Second quarter creative growth drivers included continued strength in acquisition, engagement and retention across our customer segments. Momentum in the small and medium business segment, where our team's offering continues to drive new customer acquisition. Demand for our flagship products including Photoshop, Illustrator and Premiere. Mobile applications where our Ending ARR grew greater than 30% year-over-year exiting the quarter. Adobe Stock where we saw strong book of business growth across organizations and new customers and momentum. And momentum in new businesses with strong growth and Frame IO as well as our substance offerings, which grew Ending ARR greater than 60% year-over-year exiting the quarter. Adobe achieved Document Cloud revenue of $595 million, which represents 27% year-over-year growth, or 28% in constant currency. Document Cloud continues to be our fastest growing business given the relevance and importance of PDF the knowledge workers around the globe. We added 107 million of net new Document Cloud ARR in the quarter. Second quarter Document Cloud growth drivers included continued strength and acquisition engagement retention for Acrobat across our customer segments. Momentum in the small and medium business segment and the reseller channel continuing to drive New Document Cloud subscriptions. Continued growth of searches online for document actions funneling millions of new customers into our document franchise through Acrobat Web. Strength in mobile with Ending ARR growing greater than 40% year-over-year exiting the quarter, and strong adoption of Acrobat with integrated sign capabilities within organizations of all sizes. Our document business also had a strong quarter and sales of Acrobat perpetual licenses.

In Q2, we continued to focus on making disciplined investments to drive growth, including marketing campaigns and headcount additions in our R&D and sales organizations. We're pleased with our success in talent acquisition during the quarter in a competitive market. Adobe's effective tax rate in Q2 was 21% on a GAAP basis, and 18.5% on a non-GAAP basis. The increase in the GAAP tax rate is primarily due to the lower than expected tax benefits associated with stock based compensation and geographic mix of earnings. RPO exiting the quarter was $13.82 billion growing 13% year-over-year, or 15% year-over-year when factoring in a 2% foreign exchange headwind.

In Q2, we repurchased approximately 1.9 million shares at a cost of $800 million. We currently have $9.5 billion remaining of our $15 billion authorization granted in December 2020, which goes through 2024. We will now provide Q3 targets as well as an update on the annual targets we provided in December factoring in the following four items. First, in March, we stated that as a result of lower than expected tax benefits associated with stock based compensation, our effective tax rates would increase in fiscal 2022. Second, in March, we outlined the impact of the on-going war in Ukraine, and our decision to cease all new sales in Russia and Belarus, resulting in an expected $75 million revenue impact on our digital media business. Third, as a result of the continued strength of the U.S. dollar, we are now factoring in an incremental effects headwind of $175 million across Q3 and Q4 revenue. And fourth while demand for our products remains strong, we now expect the second half of the fiscal year to show more pronounced summer seasonality in Q3 and the enterprise business with a stronger sequential increasing Q4. As a result, for Q3 we are targeting total Adobe revenue of approximately $4.43 billion, net New Digital Media ARR of approximately $430 million. Digital Media segment revenue growth of approximately 13% year-over-year, or 16% in constant currency. Digital Experience segment revenue growth of approximately 12% year-over-year, or 14% in constant currency. Digital Experience subscription revenue growth of approximately 13% year-over-year, or 15% in constant currency; tax rate of approximately 22.5% on a GAAP basis, and 18.5% on a non-GAAP basis, and GAAP earnings per share of approximately $2.35 and non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $3.33. For fiscal year 2022, we're now targeting total Adobe revenue of approximately $17.65 billion. Net New Digital Media ARR of approximately $1.90 billion. Digital Media segment revenue growth of approximately 12% year-over-year, or 17% on an adjusted basis. Digital Experience segment revenue growth of approximately 14% year-over-year, or 17% on an adjusted basis. Digital Experience subscription revenue growth of approximately 15% year-over-year, or 19% on an adjusted basis. Tax rate of approximately 21% on a GAAP basis, and 18.5% on a non-GAAP basis, and GAAP earnings per share of approximately $9.95 and non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $13.50. In summary, I'm pleased by the way Adobe executed in Q2. We are driving growth across Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and Experience Cloud with momentum in our established businesses and early success in our new initiatives. As a result of our disciplined operating model and focused execution, we were able to dramatically reduce the expected impact of increased tax rates and FX headwinds on our EPS. The investments we're making today in people, products and marketing will enable us to drive strong growth for years to come. And we are on track for another year of record revenue and operating cash flows. Shantanu, back to you.\nShantanu Narayen: Thanks, Dan. We are proud of our strong Q2 performance across Creative Cloud Document Cloud and Experience Cloud. Adobe remains one of the greatest places to work in the industry. And I want to thank our employees for their relentless dedication. This quarter, Forbes named us a top employer for college graduates, and we were ranked on their list of America's best employers for diversity. I'm thrilled to welcome our largest cohort of interns and university graduates this summer. Demand for our category defining products and services continue to grow. We're innovating at rapid speed for new and existing customer segments, accelerating our leadership in established categories, and seeing strong momentum for our newer initiatives. Our strategy remains to focus on long term growth initiatives while delivering world class profitability. Our business fundamentals and market tailwinds are strong. And I've never been more confident in our ability to execute on the $205 billion market opportunity ahead of us. I will now turn it back over to Jonathan.\nJonathan Vaas: Thanks, Shantanu. Adobe MAX, our creativity conference will take place during the third week of October this year in Los Angeles. On day one at MAX on Tuesday, October 18 we plan to host the financial analyst meeting. Invitations including discounted registration information will be sent to our analyst and investor email list later this summer. More information about the event can be found online@max.adobe.com. We would now be happy to take your questions. And we ask that you limit your questions to one per person. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will go to our first question from Kirk Materne of Evercore ISI.\nKirk Materne: Hi guys, thanks very much and congrats on the strong results. Shantanu and Anil I was wondering if you guys could just talk a little bit about the type of conversations you're having with your enterprise customers these days, given the macro backdrop. Are you seeing any hesitancy to spend? Obviously, you guys are keeping your full year guidance, despite all these headwinds, but I was also just curious if there's any change in kind of the type of deals your is it more smaller deals but more deals? Or is the product mix changing at all on the experience cloud side? I was just wondering if you could give us some color on that because that obviously remains a very primary concern for folks these days. Thanks.\nShantanu Narayen: Thanks Kirk. Yes, we are pleased with what we saw in the quarter. In the conversations that we're having, both Anil and I would first say that the interest level in executives all around the world, is very high. Unlike last time, I would say right now, the focus is also a lot on execution. So a lot of the investments that people have made in digital, they recognize that given how critical the imperative is to engage with customers digitally. So we're actually pleased both Adobe as well as if you look at the entire systems integrator and partner network, they are finding that there's a lot of demand for implementation on Adobe products. I think the other part of the conversation that you all have with enterprise CEOs right now is they all recognize it's an uncertain time. And that's the conversation that we have. But despite that uncertain macroeconomic environment, the thing that all of them recognize is that Digital is a priority. And they really want to continue to have conversations with us as to how they can do Digital. I\u2019ll have Anil maybe add a little bit of what he's seeing across different verticals as well. But the importance of digital remains undiminished.\nAnil Chakravarthy: Yes thanks Shantanu. Just to add a little bit on the vertical color, we were really pleased with some of the wins we had in Q2. If you look at the automotive and what we had with Daimler over in Europe, where we continued our strength in sports media and entertainment with NFL, which is using the real time CDP for personalization at scale across their fan base. And in healthcare, where we had a really important win with CVS. That was a great validation of all the HIPAA readiness we built into our platform So that opens up a big market opportunity. So we were really pleased those wins and as you said digital continues to be a priority. And we're seeing that in the pipeline for the second half.\nOperator: And, Kirk, did you have anything further?\nKirk Materne: No, that was that. I'll keep to my one question limit. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: And we'll go next to Brent Thill of Jefferies.\nBrent Thill: Good afternoon. Dan, I was curious if you could just comment on the more pronounced summer seasonality. What are you seeing this year versus perhaps in past years, and just a quick follow up on the numbers? The net new ARR guide was down Q2 to Q3. And I think last quarter; you said it would be up? Do we misinterpret what you said last quarter? I just want to make sure we clarify that. Thanks.\nShantanu Narayen: Yes, Brent, the way I would describe it as we had a strong first half, and we actually continue to see a strong demand for our unique solutions. And all of our new initiatives as well as the established businesses are doing well. I guess what we're also paying attention to is, what we all read as part of the macro environment. And when I look at what we expect for our second half, the confidence remains undiminished. The question really for us is timing. And maybe we're being a little cautious as it relates to what happens, given the summer seasonality, as Brent better than most is, sort of the July and August. So as it relates to our second half pipeline, the confidence remains undiminished. And we're just maybe a little cautious as it relates to timing. In terms of what we had said, in March, you're right, we had sort of alluded to the fact that we would have expected some sequential increase; clearly we had a strong Q2. But that's part of the reason why we wanted to give a little bit of color and be transparent on how we see it. And as you notice, we reaffirm the $1.9 billion for net new ARR for the year.\nBrent Thill: Thanks, Shantanu.\nOperator: And we'll go next to a question from Brad Sills of Bank of America.\nBrad Sills: Oh, great. Thanks, guys, for taking my question. I wanted to ask about Creative Cloud Express. You mentioned some new features here imaging video, editing for Acrobat, it seems to me like those are, would be considered typically premium features. Is there any change in strategy with Creative Cloud Express as to where you see that playing in different segments of the market? Thank you.\nDavid Wadhwani: Yes, thanks for the question. First of all, we're really thrilled with the reception of Creative Cloud Express, Adobe Express into the market. And frankly, it's been a lot of fun for us because it's a product that everyone at Adobe can also be using, it's amazing to see the creativity coming out of finance and legal for example. As a reminder, just to sort of up level for a second, we've been focused on the communicator and creator economy, ecosystem for years. In fact, we believe that we're the largest provider of creative tools to professionals and communicators on the back of our core products. So I want to just make sure people recognize that the core products are playing to this incredibly large market, where we see Express filling in is that Express is additive and broadens the region, that new communicator base, because of exactly what you're saying the freemium business model, there's zero friction onboarding, it's clearly showing that we're able to attract millions of new users into the franchise. And we're able to do it very efficiently by optimizing how we onboard customers from search terms that typically were not ones that we've focused on in the past. We also look at the ability to onboard those users and differentiate the offering, with the integration of these amazing features that we get from the from the desktop applications like Adobe magic. And all of this helps differentiate what we're doing with Express. And if we take a step back and look at it from a business perspective, we feel very confident that Adobe Express and the way we actually pull people into that funnel is additive to the market opportunity that we're playing. So we're really emphasizing the ability to add more capabilities there and differentiate there. I do also want to remind folks that that Express is also available to core Creative Cloud customers. And by integrating some of those features into Express, we're enabling workflows between the core Creative Cloud products and also Express and we believe that's going to have a strong retentive value on the core base and we just had, in fact, a great quarter with very strong retention for Creative Cloud as well.\nBrad Sills: Thank you so much.\nShantanu Narayen: Brad maybe if I were to add, I think the team is actually having a lot of fun with all these cool features. To your point, they're showing some incredible stuff as part of the quick actions. But if you look at the depth of what they have, I mean, there is so much behind the scenes that we will be able to monetize. But clearly the focus is on usage right now, as David said. It's been fun.\nBrad Sills: Great to hear. Thank you so much.\nOperator: We'll go next to Alex Zukin of Wolfe Research.\nAlex Zukin: Yes, hey guys, thanks for taking the question. I guess maybe just a two part. The first one, we've talked, I think a lot about pricing tailwinds during last quarter in terms of the impact for the year, and I guess can you help us just quantify the impact that you're anticipating for Q3 and Q4. Because it does, it does look to start ramping here pretty meaningfully. And then Shantanu, I guess, maybe just for you with respect to the strategic approach to M&A and kind of what's on the horizon, given the change in valuation paradigms in the market, how important is either large strategic M&A to the growth profile of the business versus tuck-ins?\nShantanu Narayen: I think as it relates to your M&A question, and then David could certainly answer the other one, clearly valuations to your point have changed quite a bit. And the first thing I'll start off by saying is, we're really pleased with our portfolio. If you look at some of the new initiatives, and we've touched on that, whether it's Adobe Express, whether it's the real time CDP customer journey analytics, what we're doing with things on the web, including PDF, we feel really good. I do feel Alex that there are going to be a number of small single product companies that are probably not going to survive, what's happening. And the valuation sort of multiple changing is actually I think, good for a larger company like Adobe. So I, it doesn't feel like we need anything, but we will always be on the lookout for things that are additive, that are adjacent, and that will provide great shareholder value and our metrics associated with ensuring great technology, great cultural fit, and adjacency remain. But we have so much going on within the company that we're excited about our current portfolio, clearly, things will be more reasonable in terms of M&A as well.\nDavid Wadhwani: And on pricing, Alex, you're right. We did sort of introduce a modest price increase to a portion of our customer base in Q2, the new prices were in market for about a month and drove a little under 10 million of benefit, which is exactly what we were expecting. And as you can see, it's a very small part of the 464 million that we drove in Q2. Customer reaction overall to this has been good, because we've added so many new features since the last price update that it's been very positive overall. And in fact, if we get asked anything by analysts, it's why we didn't make a bigger price increase. And the reality there is we're primarily focused on adding millions of new users. We are a growth business. We want to continue to grow the user base. And we believe that with the initiatives we have around both the core and the new products, we want to run the business through acquisition of new users engagement and retention.\nAlex Zukin: Got it. And sorry, Dan, just maybe just the impact on Q3 that you're anticipating in the guide for net New ARR on pricing?\nDavid Wadhwani: Yes, that we want to provide that as part of the guide. I think the metrics that David gave you, around Q2, give you a good sense of the expected actions that we anticipate going forward.\nAlex Zukin: Thank you guys.\nOperator: And we'll go next to Saket Kalia of Barclays.\nSaket Kalia: Okay, great. Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question here. David, maybe just to stay with you, given the questions on macro, I was wondering if we could go one level deeper into the makeup of Creative ARR. We have the very helpful disclosure from analysts say the single app versus the all-out mix, which is helpful. But how do you think about the mix from maybe consumers versus professionals if there's a way to break that down? Because of course, right now, there are lots of questions just about the health of the consumer. How do you think about that mix? And how do you think about maybe the defensiveness or the retention rates on both of those different cohorts? Does that make sense?\nDavid Wadhwani: Yes, it makes perfect sense. Yes happy to take that one. So at a high level we think about the business through obviously multiple segmentations. But as you're looking at it, we think about it as enterprise buyers, midmarket and SMB buyers, communicators and consumers. So we have a very broad and diverse portfolio, which has served us very well in the past. And, and as you as you are alluding to, we've been through multiple recessions before so we have some good insight into how these different cohorts respond to difficult financial times. And overall, we fared very well. Enterprises we've talked about, you heard Anil and Shantanu talk about content is fueling the digital economy and needing to stay very focused on their digital investments. From a pro market perspective, we have professionals that are making their living using our products. So we feel very good about that offering, as well. From a communicators perspective, they tend to be either working in departments or small businesses, or they're part of this growing movement around the creative economy. And they're aspiring to make money or build followers with that. So it's an essential part of their, their toolset that they're going to do to grow their side hustle in their activities. And as it relates to the consumer businesses, we've been very thoughtful with pricing there, and have had very attractive pricing that we think has fared very well for us in the past around, through recession. So, overall, we think the business is diverse, and we see the business is very resilient.\nSaket Kalia: Very helpful. Thanks.\nOperator: And we'll go to our next question from Karl Keirstead of UBS.\nKarl Keirstead: Hi, thanks very much. I'd love to ask about the digital experience guide. You said it for 14% in the third quarter, that's down about four points in constant currency from 18% in May, and is the lowest and a bit. I know it's a tougher comp is, is that the issue? Or is there anything else to call out on the DX business? Thanks a lot.\nShantanu Narayen: Nothing Karl to call out. I mean, if you look at what our targets are for the year, and if you look at it in terms of what we would expect, for both subscription and total revenue we\u2019re in effect saying exactly the same at the beginning of the year, in what's a really tough economic environment. So the interest in our solutions remain strong. I also wanted to maybe add to a little bit of what David said to for Saket. The consumer sentiment that we continue to hear from banks, such as yourselves, is that the consumer sentiment actually continues to remain strong, both in the U.S. and in Europe. So I didn't want to have anybody feel like that's not what we're seeing as well.\nKarl Keirstead: Thank you.\nOperator: And we'll move to our next question from Jay Vleeschhouwer of Griffin Securities.\nJay Vleeschhouwer: Thank you. Good evening, I'd like to ask about two important attributes of your product led growth strategy. First, could you comment on the contribution from or expectations for what you call your application and intelligent services? Is that becoming meaningful at this point? And then secondly, at Summit a couple of months ago, and again this evening, we heard multiple examples of integration within and across your segments, which is long standing Adobe practice. But we've heard a great deal more about that the last couple of years. Could you comment on which of the many integrations you think either in terms of addressable market, or your own sales capacities might be the most meaningful over the next number of quarters and years?\nDavid Wadhwani: Thanks. Thanks for the question, Jay. In terms of the application intelligence services, it fits really well into the portfolio of our Adobe Experience platform based services. So just to recap, we have three major services the real time CDP customer journey analytics, and the journey optimizer. And what we have done is really integrated these intelligence services as part of these applications that run natively on the Adobe Experience platform. And where that has been extremely valuable to us is, we have a broad base of customers through our digital experience portfolios, for example, with Adobe analytics, we have that's been the gold standard for a long time on for web traffic analysis and trends and insights. And with customer journey analytics, our enterprise customers can now get a 360 degree view of everything that's happening across the customer journey, whether it's web traffic or, or through mobile apps, social call center, and so on. And that's where the intelligence services really fit in, to really be able to expand the portfolio and derive value from how you segment those into audiences and activate them.\nJay Vleeschhouwer: Okay and the second part of the question\nDavid Wadhwani: If you could repeat the second part of the question please?\nJay Vleeschhouwer: Oh, sure. I was trying to get some insights into which of the many integrations that you've done either within or across your segments, whether it's Digital Media DX, or combinations thereof, you think had had or will have the most meaningful impacts, assuming that not all of these integrations are created equally.\nShantanu Narayen: I\u2019ll start off maybe on that particular question, Jay, because one of the areas that we're seeing just tremendous interest is what we are referring to as content supply chain. And both David and Anil can touch on that as well, a little bit more. But this notion of people creating campaigns, if you agree with us that the greatest value that we can provide is enabling every enterprise to do personalization at scale, the amount of content that's being created, the amount of content that's being delivered, and to understand the efficacy of the campaigns, is just absolutely top of mind. I mean, we have a large, large consumer company that has completely consolidated all of their marketing activity to really understand what this content supply chain is. And so the notion of content supply chain, and what we can do between our creative applications, the asset management that we deliver, the website and what we are doing with AEM Experienced Manager, that and work front to be able to do workflow associated with that, that is really resonating with every single customer right now.\nJay Vleeschhouwer: Great, thank you.\nOperator: And we will go next to Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley.\nKeith Weiss: Thank you guys for taking the question. I have a question for Dan. And it's about sort of the guidance philosophy. And that these are what a lot of people are trying to get at is understanding holding the Digital Media ARR guide at 1.9 billion for the full year, despite the kind of increased seasonality in Q3, despite the fact like the street kind of gave you a pass, we've already taken our numbers down to like 1.8 billion. Why keep that risk out there? Why push more risk into Q4? Why put a high bar out there when obviously, it's not in the stock? All the stocks are getting killed here. It's not in our expectations, like, what is it that gives you so much confidence to like, keep that number out there.\nDavid Wadhwani: So I guess where I'd start is, if you take a look at where we are in, in the first half, I would say the performance of the businesses is really good. We talked about it earlier conversations with the customers, what we're seeing in data and DDOM and the insights that it gives us, we see strength into the back half of the year. So we're confident in the underlying performance of the business. And, I'd go back to the earlier comments, we see the headlines we see what others are talking about. And so in an environment like this, maybe we're a little cautious about Q3, I think that's the prudent way to go. But it doesn't take away from the insights we have and the belief we have and confidence in the underlying performance and the strength we see into the second half. And so I think we've taken everything into account. And we've got the right set of targets out there that reflect what we're seeing in the business and how we expect to perform.\nKeith Weiss: Got it. And I mean, any visibility into what gets better in Q4 that that's kind of enabled it because you're looking for net New AAR to go from basically down in the first half of the year to growing in the back half what, what could you give us any kind of visibility to like, what gives you guys that confidence?\nShantanu Narayen: If you look at the rhythm of how we\u2019ve managed the business, certainly, you look at what happens with education in Q4, you look at the enterprise, which tends to be a seasonally strong Q4. You start to look at what's happening with the emerging businesses that will continue to ramp. And so, it's a combination I think somebody else alluded to pricing, and we'll have a full quarter of pricing as well. And so, when you put all of those together, every Q3 to Q4 we see a seasonal uptick. And if you look at what happened even last year, and you look at what the numbers look like it's something that we know we're going to go drive.\nKeith Weiss: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll go next to Tyler Radke with Citi.\nTyler Radke: Yes, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask you about the CDP space. I think you talked about your revenue, they're doubling year-over-year. I guess just a couple of questions. Number one, how significant is CDP as part of the overall experience businesses is a growth driver; and two, could you just talk a little bit about the competitive landscape. This is something that Sales force talked a lot about, on their last earnings call. We've seen amplitude recently launched a CDP. So how do you kind of see all this evolving? And how do you think this plays out? Thank you.\nDavid Wadhwani: Thanks Tyler. Yes, but let me take the big picture first on what we see with the overall CDP market. First of all, all the interest in CDP is a great validation of the fact that the traditional CRM is not the way to go to build the next generation, customer experience. Some of the data might be there, but you really need to activate the data and construct a rich profile before you can activate that. So if we look at the CDP market, what we see is, from our perspective, it's the platform for full customer engagement. And then that involves a number of different components. You look at the data collection that's required. And we built a lot of connectors, not only with our apps, we have over 100 connectors out there for the data collection, then you need to be able to assemble that into a real time database so that you can make the next best action the next best offer. We call it personalization at scale to millions of people in milliseconds. And that real time customer profile needs to be activated. And third, it then becomes the platform for not just the apps in our portfolio. But then for example, the integration we have with Dynamics, for example, with customer service, or the integration we have with ServiceNow, and so on, it needs to become the customer data platform that serves the entire range of customer facing applications. That's the way we look at CDP. That's what makes it a broad and exciting market. And that's really where we're differentiated where when we talk to customers, I mean, I'll give you the examples of say CVS, and NFL and so on, they recognize and agree with that vision. And that's why they're betting on us. And most of the players you see do one piece of it and don't really have the either the comprehensive nature of the product in their portfolio, or the real ability to pull it off in a true real time manner.\nShantanu Narayen: Maybe the one thing I would add to all of that is, we have 32 billion profiles right now. I mean, clearly every customer has their profile kept isolated. So we're clearly the leader as it relates to you know, large companies that have a CDP in the market. That's well done.\nTyler Radke: Thank you.\nOperator: And we'll move next to Gregg Moskowitz with Mizuho.\nGregg Moskowitz: Okay, thank you for taking the question. Can you talk about the Express Your Brand program, obviously, Meta has huge small business reach, but it will be helpful to get your expectations on what this partnership will do for Adobe incrementally. Thanks.\nDavid Wadhwani: Yes, so happy to do that. It's been a it's actually a very exciting program for us. So as you know, Adobe Express is predominantly focused on communicators, small medium businesses, as they start to move more online. We've talked a lot about the rise of the creative economy, we've mentioned that there are hundreds of millions of small medium businesses that are really targeting more online communication and really focus on social media, in fact that in a recent survey, we found that the majority of small medium businesses actually say that their online presence is more important than their physical presence. And so they need to do coordinate and communicate digitally and our ability to provide with meta provide all the tools that they need end-to-end to build incredible content that stands out and participate in the online experience that that meta is providing. And, of course, also work more broadly across all the other social networks, I think, is a really great opportunity for meta, for us and certainly for the small medium business owners that are part of that program.\nGregg Moskowitz: Okay, thank you.\nJonathan Vaas: Hi, operator, we're coming up on the top of the hour. We'll take two more questions, please.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll go next to Kash Rangan of Goldman Sachs.\nKash Rangan: Hey thank you very much, Shantanu and team. This upcoming maybe recession is the one that everybody has been predicting. And the company has, as David said, has been through a couple of recessions before. The company's a very different company today than it was even just a few years ago. What is your best prognosis as to how the portfolio of Adobe products behaves if we are to enter a downturn, not that we wish it but if we are to enter one, how do you think the portfolio is positioned? And in the financial angle are you prepared to at all slow down firing? The beauty of the subscription model is that the instant start on hiring and produce nice margin upset that sort of thing from a financial perspective, but curious to get your thoughts overall on this particular topic \nShantanu Narayen: Sure, let me first cover your second part cash as it relates to the bottom line. And our philosophy right now, given all of the myriad opportunities that we have is, we're planning for the upside, we know how to react to the downside, when that happens. I mean, look at what's happened with the tax rate, and the team, and the financial team and the product teams, what they were able to do to really address all of that is truly remarkable. I mean, we take it for granted at the company, but we've done an amazing, amazing job at continuing to be extremely profitable. For me, I think, when you talk about a recession, the question I ask people is, when you look at the three things that Adobe does, which is focus on content, focus on automation, focus on customer engagement, I just don't look at any of those and feel like the secular trend for that will change. So there may be some change in the rhythm of that quarter-over-quarter. But the fundamental shift of what we are doing, I mean, Anil talked about this real time CDP customer engagement is going to be the only thing that differentiates a business from another business, and the success that we're seeing in healthcare, clearly points to that as well. So, we\u2019ll navigate it, we have an incredibly experienced management team. We're planning for the upside right now, which is all of our growth initiatives and will react as appropriate. And we are clearly not going to be in denial. But right now, it feels like a very strong time for Adobe to continue to execute against the things that we have on our plate.\nDavid Wadhwani: Yes, just want to build a little bit on the first part of Shantanu\u2019s answer. We talked about offsetting some of the headwinds we see. We talked about the increase in tax rate. We talked about the FX headwind into the back half of the year. In Q1, we discussed the impact we were seeing from the war in Ukraine. When we take the effects and the impact we discussed in Q1, that's a $250 million revenue, headwind in the back half of the year, the increase in tax rate is about a $0.25 a share impactful year. When I net both of those together, we would expect to see about $0.60 to $0.70 a share erosion of the earnings power of the company. And to Shantanu\u2019s point, it really underscores a philosophy that's underpinned how this company has operated for a very long time. It's about focused execution. It's about operating discipline. And the fact that the full year targets have come down $0.20 when the map would suggest it should be much greater than that just really underscores the power of the model. We're investing for innovation. We're investing to serve our customers, but we're doing it in a very focused and disciplined way. And I think that says a lot about who we are as a company.\nKash Rangan: Thank you, Dan.\nOperator: And our last question is from Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank.\nBrad Zelnick: Excellent, thanks for squeezing me in and congrats on a strong Q2. My question is for David. David, we've seen reports of the trial, you're running in Canada for a free browser based version of Photoshop, which I assume is another Express like offering to build top of funnel interest and awareness. Can you share more about the strategy here? And how you think about the balance of more simplified products, creating incremental demand versus competing with more premium skews?\nDavid Wadhwani: Yes, absolutely happy to talk about that. We are very excited about the work we're doing here. Frankly, not just with Adobe Express but with Photoshop, as we mentioned here with Lightroom, as we've done in the past, and also with, with Acrobat. Our focus has always been to take the strengths that we have in the desktop and build a multi surface experience for our customers across desktop, mobile and web. And as we've done that, we've noticed that web and mobile really represents an opportunity to broaden our audience in a very significant way. And we do that by capturing search, traffic and at the point of intent, bringing them into the zero friction web experience with a freemium model. And so PS web and what you're seeing there is a step along that journey for our core imaging franchise. And we absolutely anticipate it being a source of funnel opportunity, similar to the way that that Acrobat has seen Acrobat web as a source of that funnel activity. You see how strong the core Acrobat businesses and how it's performing. We have a version of Acrobat web that's available we've been able to double traffic to that. And we now have over 50 million monthly active users, leveraging Acrobat web. And we use that as a top of leveraging Acrobat web on a monthly active basis. And we're able to leverage that and convert that traffic into real business. We're playing that same playbook now with Photoshop as well. And we expect that to be a very productive opportunity.\nBrad Zelnick: Thank you.\nShantanu Narayen: I think if I were to add to that, I mean, really, in effect, what we do is we look at platforms in an unbelievably expensive way. And on any platform, just making sure that we get the magic of our technology and as friction free way possible, is part of what we are continuing to do. And we have a unbelievably rigorous process also or then really understanding how to monetize it. So some of the press releases may be a little bit more sensationalistic, in terms of how they announced that, Brad. But since that was the last question, I just have to say we're proud of how we're executing against our strategy. I mean, everybody would have knowledge that it's an uncertain macroeconomic environment. But we believe that we will continue to win by delivering great innovative products that at the end of the day delight and ever increasing for our set of customers. We're making some very creative marketing campaigns. We have strong sales and go-to-market motions that are appropriate for the set of customers that we're targeting. And I think we're the being the best users of our product, which actually gives us tremendous credibility, to both innovate at a rapid pace, as well as deliver great customer satisfaction and growth to our customers worldwide. So thank you for joining us. And with that, I'll turn it over to Jonathan.\nJonathan Vaas: Great, thanks. Thanks everyone for joining the call. We look forward to speaking to many of you soon and this does conclude the event. Thank you."}, {"symbol": "ADBE", "quarter": 1, "year": 2022, "date": "2022-03-22 21:59:05", "content": "Operator: Good day and welcome to the Q1 FY 2022 Adobe Earnings Call. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jonathan Vaas.

Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Before I discuss our Q1 results, I want to acknowledge the horrifying and heartbreaking crisis in Ukraine. The pain and suffering of millions of innocent civilians is incredibly tragic and our thoughts and prayers are with the Ukrainian people. Adobe joins the global community in taking a stand by stopping all new sales of our products and services in Russia. The Adobe Foundation has made grants to aid humanitarian relief efforts. I am proud of how our teams have come together and continue to successfully manage our business throughout the most challenging of times while focusing on delighting customers and the long-term growth initiatives for the company. Adobe has always had a strong purpose-driven culture and that has never been more evident than it is today. Adobe\u2019s mission to change the world through digital experiences is more critical than ever before. Everywhere we look, whether it is in entertainment, education or the enterprise, content is fueling the global economy. The democratization of creativity, emergence of new ways to work and learn from anywhere and the business mandate for personalized customer experiences underscore the immense opportunities we have as a company. Our strategy to unleash creativity for all, accelerate document productivity and power digital businesses is working. Our innovation engine is delivering category-leading products, services and platforms across Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and Experience Cloud. Adobe had a strong Q1. We achieved a record $4.26 billion in revenue, representing 17% year-over-year growth on an adjusted basis. GAAP earnings per share for the quarter were $2.66 and non-GAAP earnings per share, was $3.37. In our Digital Media business, we drove strong growth in both Creative Cloud and Document Cloud, achieving $3.11 billion in revenue. Net new Digital Media annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, was $418 million, and total Digital Media ARR exiting Q1 grew to $12.57 billion. In our Experience Cloud business, we built on our Q4 momentum, achieving $1.06 billion in revenue, and subscription revenue was $932 million for the quarter. I am pleased to have David Wadhwani, President, Digital Media; and Anil Chakravarthy, President, Digital Experience, on this call to share more about our momentum in the Digital Media and Digital Experience businesses, respectively. David?\nDavid Wadhwani: Thanks, Shantanu and hello everyone. The acceleration to all things digital has made content and creativity more important than ever before. Everyone needs to express themselves digitally, from the individual on social media to the student creating a more compelling school project to the creative professional making the next marketing campaign. The rapid rise of the creator economy is giving individuals, solopreneurs and small business owners the opportunity to monetize their passions, their products and their services. Creative Cloud is catalyzing these trends and fulfilling our vision for Creativity For All, enabling customers of every skill level to create content that stands out. We continue to lead in core creative categories such as imaging, design, video and illustration. And we\u2019re advancing new media types like 3D and immersive for the emerging metaverse platforms. We\u2019re building applications for every surface and every audience across web, mobile and desktop. And we\u2019re investing heavily in collaboration services that are deeply integrated into our flagship applications. Our new web-based solutions enable us to deliver value more quickly and broadly than ever before. Creative Cloud solutions are powered by Adobe Sensei, our AI engine, which enables customers to work faster and smarter. As a result, our creative community has never been stronger. Behance now has nearly 30 million members, and we continue to host hundreds of on-demand and live sessions weekly that serve as a source of learning and inspiration. As a result, in Q1, we achieved net new Creative ARR of $315 million and revenue of $2.55 billion, which grew 16% year-over-year on an adjusted basis. Q1 highlights include the launch of Creative Cloud Express, our new template-driven web and mobile product that makes it easy for anyone to create and share beautiful content. Its zero-friction onboarding will bring millions of small business owners, social influencers and students into the Creative Cloud family and empower them to create everything from social posts to marketing materials. Creative Cloud Express features thousands of gorgeous templates, millions of stunning stock images and videos and the world\u2019s most complete collection of fonts. Its easy-to-use interface is continuously expanding with innovation such as enhanced search capabilities for millions of assets and new PDF Quick Actions that enable users to edit, convert, combine and organize PDFs. While we\u2019re just a few months into our journey, we\u2019re seeing strong traffic, millions of monthly active users and high customer satisfaction. On the video front, the explosive demand for video content shows no signs of abating. In Q1, we launched new AI-powered innovations in Premiere Pro that help merge music into video sequences and accelerate transcriptions. We also drove strong growth for Frame.io, the leading video collaboration solution Adobe acquired late last year. Frame had its best quarter ever, closing more deals than in any prior quarter while increasing deal sizes to record levels. As creativity has become a team sport, we will extend our leadership in video collaboration and bring collaboration capabilities to all creative categories. We are also seeing tremendous interest for Substance 3D and our new 3D Modeler beta as brands bring together the physical and digital worlds and begin their journeys to become metaverse-ready. Substance is already being adopted by global brands like Coca-Cola, NASCAR and NVIDIA for marketing and e-commerce. Finally, we continue to see strong demand for Creative Cloud offerings globally across all segments: individuals, SMBs, teams and enterprises with key wins at Disney, the FAA, IBM, ING Bank, Kohl\u2019s and the New Mexico Public Education Department. On the Document Cloud side, digital documents have become the foundation of how businesses run and will continue to gain significance as hybrid work becomes the standard. Adobe is accelerating document productivity with Document Cloud, enabling all capabilities, including editing, converting, sharing, scanning and signing to be frictionless across web, desktop and mobile. PDFs are getting smarter and more accessible through our continued investment in AI and ML. And we\u2019re enabling new workflows through our APIs by empowering developers to build customized digital document experiences for their businesses. In Q1, we achieved record revenue of $562 million and net new Document Cloud ARR of $103 million. Ending ARR for Document Cloud crossed the $2 billion mark, which represents 29% year-over-year growth. Q1 highlights include strong growth in Adobe Sign, driven by unifying e-signature functionality in Acrobat and new Sign integrations with Adobe Commerce and Workfront. On the web, we continue to see a high volume of searches for document actions such as editing, converting and sharing PDFs. As a result, Acrobat Web\u2019s contribution to the business has nearly doubled year-over-year. On mobile, we saw billions of Acrobat mobile PDFs opened in Q1. This usage, combined with our efforts to convert users to paid subscribers on mobile, is working. Acrobat mobile ARR grew over 70% year-over-year. And lastly, our Document Cloud enterprise business continues to do well with key wins including Medallia, Mercedes-Benz, Raytheon, Ricoh Europe, Shimizu and UnitedHealth. We have responded to the needs of professionals by adding a broad array of features to our flagship applications across both Creative Cloud and Document Cloud. And we\u2019re attracting millions of new users, including a significant number of non-pros, with Acrobat and Creative Cloud Express on web and mobile. Our increasing breadth of offerings not only expand our ability to reach new customers but also enable us to further personalize pricing across our offerings starting later in Q2. I will now pass it to Anil.\nAnil Chakravarthy: Thanks, David. Hello, everyone. Over the last 2 years, the digital economy has exploded as we have experienced a profound global shift in how we work, learn and play. Telehealth visits are now the norm rather than the exception. Customers and businesses are engaging and transacting digitally. Online shopping is now essential, and the U.S. is on track to surpass $1 trillion in e-commerce sales this year, according to the Adobe Digital Economy Index. To succeed, companies must make the digital economy personal with powerful digital experiences that can be personalized to millions of customers in milliseconds. Adobe Experience Cloud is a comprehensive set of integrated AI-driven applications and services to help companies deliver experiences across all aspects of the customer journey. At its core is the Adobe Experience Platform with billions of customer profiles. Our Adobe Experience Cloud applications span the entire customer funnel, from acquisition to monetization to retention, across content and commerce, customer journeys, data insights and audiences and marketing workflow. We have made the dramatic transformation to deliver AI-driven services with over 80% of Experience Cloud customers now using Adobe Sensei, our industry-leading AI and ML framework to power experiences for their customers. Last week, we hosted Adobe Summit, the world\u2019s largest digital experience conference. We launched exciting new Experience Cloud technology and heard from executives from some of the world\u2019s most interesting and innovative brands, including BMW, Nike, Prada, Real Madrid and Walgreens Boots Alliance. We enabled the entire event using Experience Cloud, personalizing the experience for our global attendees. Summit content has had over 22 million views to date, underscoring the significant interest and demand for digital transformation. We continue to drive outstanding growth in our Experience Cloud business. The pandemic has caused brands around the world to realize the critical need for digital transformation. And we\u2019re adding new logos while continuing to focus on driving significant value realization for our existing customers. In Q1, we achieved $1.06 billion in revenue. Subscription revenue was $932 million for the quarter, representing 22% year-over-year growth on an adjusted basis. Q1 highlights include a slate of exciting product innovations, including new real-time customer data capabilities with the integration of Adobe Real-Time CDP and Adobe Target. Adobe Real-Time CDP is used by a large and growing base of customers such as DICK\u2019S Sporting Goods, Henkel, Panera, Real Madrid, ServiceNow and Verizon; new cross-cloud integrations, including a unified workflow between Workfront, Creative Cloud Enterprise and Experience Manager assets that powers end-to-end content creation and delivery; strong performance in Adobe Experience Manager, emphasizing the need for unified content management to meet the ever-increasing demand for content at speed and scale. Adobe is uniquely positioned to help customers across the content supply chain; new APIs that provide developers with the flexibility to create customized user experiences on top of Adobe Commerce; the general availability of Adobe Experience Cloud for Healthcare to deliver personalized health care experiences; an expanding partner ecosystem, including a partnership with OneTrust to simplify consent management; the next phase of e-commerce integrations with FedEx, Walmart and PayPal as well as a collaboration with The Weather Company; and key customer wins, including CrowdStrike, Deutsche Telekom, IBM, Jaguar Land Rover, JPMorgan Chase, McDonald\u2019s and UnitedHealth. Our Experience Cloud product innovation, global customer base and vibrant partner ecosystem are driving our continued success. We are executing across our entire go-to-market motion and continue to receive strong industry recognition. This quarter, Adobe was named a leader in 3 industry analyst reports focused on core customer experience management segments, including Gartner\u2019s Magic Quadrant for Digital Experience Platforms, the inaugural IDC MarketScape for CDPs for Front Office and the Forrester Wave for Digital Asset Management. Dan, over to you.\nDan Durn: Thanks, Anil. Today, I will start by summarizing Adobe\u2019s performance in Q1 fiscal 2022, highlighting growth drivers across our businesses, and I\u2019ll finish with targets for Q2. Adobe\u2019s strong financial results demonstrate the company\u2019s ability to execute in a challenging macroeconomic and geopolitical environment. Across our business, we are attracting new customers, signing up transformational deals, growing our recurring book of business and seeing emerging businesses ramp and, in some cases, reach escape velocity. We are witnessing the digitization of everything and Adobe\u2019s products offer customers access to a digital future, underpinning how they live and work. Our investment in products, marketing and a data-driven operating model are continuing to drive Adobe\u2019s growth. In Q1, Adobe achieved record revenue of $4.26 billion, which represents 9% year-over-year growth or 17% on an adjusted basis. Business and financial highlights included GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.66 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.37; Digital Media revenue of $3.11 billion; net new Digital Media ARR of $418 million; Digital Experience revenue of $1.06 billion; cash flows from operations of $1.77 billion; RPO of $13.83 billion exiting the quarter; and repurchasing approximately 3.8 million shares of our stock during the quarter. In our Digital Media segment, we achieved 9% year-over-year revenue growth in Q1 or 17% on an adjusted basis. We exited the quarter with $12.57 billion of Digital Media ARR. Global demand for digital content continues to explode. And with the strength of Adobe\u2019s product innovation and our data-driven operating model, our net new Digital Media ARR in Q1 grew on a year-over-year basis after factoring out the additional week in the year-ago period. We achieved Creative revenue of $2.55 billion, which represents 7% year-over-year growth or 16% on an adjusted basis. We added $315 million of net new Creative ARR in the quarter. First quarter Creative growth drivers included strong creative engagement and retention across individual and SMB segments; new customer demand across large organizations, small and medium businesses, driving growth in our Creative Cloud for Teams offering, which was the highest Q1 on record; sustained growth of subscription licensing for individual flagship applications such as Photoshop, Illustrator and Premiere as well as strength in our Adobe Stock business; and enterprise adoption of new collaboration capabilities, including Frame.io as well as our 3D and immersive applications. We are also pleased by the adoption we see in some of our newer initiatives such as Creative Cloud Express, Substance as well as Acrobat, Photoshop and Illustrator on the Web. We are driving strong usage growth and have already attracted millions of monthly active users to our cloud-native offerings. We expect these businesses to be drivers of future ARR and revenue growth. Adobe achieved Document Cloud revenue of $562 million, which represents 17% year-over-year growth or 26% on an adjusted basis. We added $103 million of net new Document Cloud ARR in the quarter, surpassing $2 billion in ending ARR, growing at 29% year-over-year. Document Cloud continues to be our fastest-growing business, demonstrating that our strategy of accelerating document productivity is working and reflecting how Acrobat and PDF are essential to the way people work in a digital-first world. First quarter Document Cloud growth drivers included customer demand for Acrobat subscriptions, the strongest Q1 on record; new licensing and renewal for Acrobat for Teams offering in the SMB segment, both on adobe.com and through our reseller channel; momentum in Adobe Sign with strong year-over-year growth of Sign transactions within Acrobat; strong demand for our PDF solutions on mobile; and continued momentum with our frictionless onboarding of new customers through Acrobat Web with ARR growing approximately 90% year-over-year. Turning to our Digital Experience segment, in Q1, we achieved revenue of $1.06 billion, which represents 13% year-over-year growth or 20% on an adjusted basis. Digital Experience subscription revenue was $932 million, representing 15% year-over-year growth or 22% on an adjusted basis. When we look at the quarterly sequential revenue growth, we continue to see acceleration as our strategy of delivering personalization at scale is resonating with enterprise customers. First quarter Digital Experience growth drivers included new logo acquisition across our solutions; strong customer retention as a result of investments we\u2019ve made in product innovation, greater value realization and customer experience; larger deal sizes in our Workfront business; traction upselling customers to new cloud-native solutions; and momentum with our Content & Commerce, customer data platform and Customer Journey Analytics offerings. In Q1, we continued to increase investments in initiatives that will drive long-term revenue growth, including ramping headcount across R&D and sales capacity. Travel and facilities remained at lower levels in Q1, but we\u2019re increasing facilities utilization and travel in Q2 as we resume in-person meetings with customers and partners. Adobe\u2019s effective tax rate in Q1 was 18% on a GAAP basis and 18.5% on a non-GAAP basis. The tax rate came in higher than expected, primarily due to less-than-expected tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation. Our trade DSO was 36 days, which compares to 38 days in the year-ago quarter and 42 days last quarter. RPO grew by 19% year-over-year to $13.83 billion exiting Q1, benefiting from enterprise bookings. Our ending cash and short-term investment position exiting Q1 was $4.70 billion and cash flows from operations in Q1 were $1.77 billion. We repurchased approximately 3.8 million shares in Q1 at a cost of $2.1 billion. Included in this purchase was the partial settlement of an accelerated share repurchase entered into during Q1 to repurchase shares at an aggregate cost of $2.4 billion. The final number of shares to be repurchased under the ASR will be based on a discount to the volume weighted average price of our common stock during the term of the agreement with the final settlement and delivery of incremental shares to Adobe scheduled to occur in early Q3. These share repurchases are part of the previously announced program, under which we currently have $10.7 billion remaining of our $15 billion authorization that was granted in December 2020 and goes through 2024. Before we get to our Q2 targets, I want to discuss the impact of the devastating situation in Ukraine. Earlier this month, Adobe announced the cessation of all new sales in Russia and Belarus. In addition, we\u2019ve made the decision to reduce our Digital Media ARR balance by $75 million, which represents all ARR for existing business in these two countries. While we will extend subscriptions automatically in Ukraine during this period and continue to provide Digital Media services, we reduced ARR by an additional $12 million, which represents our entire Ukraine business. This results in a total ARR reduction of $87 million and an expected revenue impact of $75 million for fiscal 2022. The impact toward Digital Experience business is de minimis. For Q2, we are targeting total Adobe revenue of approximately $4.34 billion; net new Digital Media ARR of approximately $440 million; Digital Media segment revenue growth of approximately 13% year-over-year or 14% in constant currency; Digital Experience segment revenue growth of approximately 15% year-over-year or 16% in constant currency; Digital Experience subscription revenue growth of approximately 17% year-over-year or 18% in constant currency; tax rate of approximately 20% on a GAAP basis and 18.5% on a non-GAAP basis; GAAP earnings per share of approximately $2.44; and non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $3.30. As a result of the lower-than-expected deductions from stock-based compensation, our effective tax rate for fiscal 2022 is now targeted to be 19.5% on a GAAP basis and 18.5% on a non-GAAP basis. As we look towards the back half of the year, we expect quarterly sequential revenue and EPS growth in Q3 and Q4. In Digital Media, we expect strong second half ARR performance across Document Cloud and Creative Cloud, including continued strength of emerging businesses like Acrobat Web, Frame.io, Substance and Creative Cloud Express. In addition, we expect ARR contributions to increase sequentially in Q3 and Q4 from a new offering and pricing structure which starts late in Q2. We expect Digital Experience bookings to show continued momentum in the second half with a traditional strong Q4 finish. We will continue to invest in product innovation, sales capacity, marketing awareness and demand generation given our immense market opportunity. As the world reopens, we expect to increase our travel and facilities expenses. In summary, I\u2019m pleased that Adobe delivered another record quarter in Q1 with sustained growth and world-class profitability. Adobe continues to show its resilience through unprecedented circumstances that all companies face today, and I\u2019m confident we will emerge stronger. We are on track for another year of strong financial performance. Shantanu, back to you.\nShantanu Narayen: Thanks, Dan. This is a transformative time at Adobe. We\u2019re engaging with hundreds of millions of customers globally, from individuals to the largest enterprises, launching new applications for new audiences and bringing our flagship category applications to new surfaces and platforms while increasing collaboration capabilities across our solutions. Adobe has a winning strategy applied to an exceptional opportunity. We\u2019re a leader in the digital economy with Adobe Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and Experience Cloud, which combined have a total addressable market of $205 billion. Few companies can consistently deliver technology innovation, successful transformation across new categories and business models and a broad ever-growing base of customers and partners. I\u2019d like to thank our 26,000 employees for their continued dedication and unwavering focus on delivering customer innovation and inventing the future of digital experiences. Thank you. We will now take questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nBrent Thill: Good afternoon. Curious if you could shed any more color on the new pricing structure and what that means. And Shantanu, beyond Ukraine, is there anything else you\u2019re seeing in the broader economy that\u2019s different than you\u2019ve seen historically? Thank you.\nShantanu Narayen: So Brent, as it relates to what we have seen first in terms of the macroeconomic situation, we actually continue to see strength. We were pleased with the strong Q1. Certainly, I think the last few weeks of the quarter, you saw some impact in Europe, specifically as it related to what happened in terms of the terrible situation in Ukraine. But I think we continue to see growth around the world. I think on the first one, as you know, and then I\u2019ll have David also add some color, the last major comprehensive overall that we had for our pricing was in 2017. And you\u2019ve seen since then the number of different initiatives that we have and offerings that we\u2019ve introduced, whether it was the 3D offerings, what we\u2019ve done on the web, what we\u2019ve done in mobile, what we\u2019ve done around Creative Cloud Express. So I think it was time to take a very comprehensive look, which David has done. And I think directionally, what I would say is that we want to continue to attract hundreds of millions to the platform, but we also want to get value for the tremendous innovation that we\u2019ve provided. David, maybe you can add a little bit more.\nDavid Wadhwani: Yes, happy to. So as Shantanu mentioned, the last pricing update and adjustment we made was in 2017. Since then, we\u2019ve added a lot to our existing offerings. We\u2019ve added new applications. We\u2019ve extended broadly across multiple services. We\u2019ve doubled down on collaboration. We\u2019ve added millions of stock assets and thousands of fonts. And we\u2019ve also introduced new offerings. Obviously, Acrobat across web and mobile has been growing for the last few years, and you heard us talk \u2013 last year or 2, you heard us talk about that in the prepared remarks. But also CCX is now in market across web and mobile. And the early success we\u2019re seeing with these new offerings across web and mobile and across Acrobat and CCX has really been the catalyst for these pricing adjustments that we\u2019re looking at doing. They let us introduce the right value with the right onboarding experience and the right pricing to attract millions of new subscribers. And they provide us the opportunity to right-size the value where engagement and usage is highest in our core existing customer base. The impact of this, we think, for Q2 will be fairly minimal because it takes time to roll this out globally, and it takes time for customers to go through their renewal cycles where their prices change. But we expect it to have a more significant impact and build-out in Q3 and Q4.\nBrent Thill: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research.\nAlex Zukin: Hi, guys. So maybe to think \u2013 to ask Brent \u2013 to ask the question a different way, if you think about Adobe has been around for a long time through many business cycles, as we \u2013 as you look at the pipeline of activity for the back half of the year and you think about the \u2013 where \u2013 how investors should think about it in a more recessionary, inflationary environment, can you just give us some color around how you think about the pipeline development, how you think about any changes with respect to the shape of the year and seasonality? And then maybe just a financial question, I think there is just a better understanding of how the mechanics of the NRR are shaping up for Q2. Are you taking that \u2013 is the $440 million, is that guide inclusive of the impact of the Russia-Ukraine adjustment? Is it taken out of the prior year? Just a little bit more context would be helpful? Thank you, guys.\nShantanu Narayen: Sure, Alex. There were multiple questions in that. So let me \u2013 maybe first, to your point, which I agree with, when you think about the rhythm of the business and maybe the seasonal cadence, clearly, that\u2019s been impacted by whether it\u2019s the external events as it relates to the pandemic or more recently the war in Ukraine. But big picture, as we look at what\u2019s happening in terms of customer adoption, what\u2019s happening in terms of the excitement, there is no question that digital is a tailwind and will continue to be a tailwind. And our perspective is that what happened was the pandemic actually put a spotlight on the importance of everything we\u2019re doing, whether it\u2019s customer engagement, whether it\u2019s content or document productivity. And so as you think about what happens seasonally, certainly, I think we would continue to see strength in Q3 and Q4. Dan referred to that in terms of the second half momentum that we would see. But even Q1, we had a strong start. So from our perspective, some of the seasonal cadence might have changed, but the secular trends in terms of up and to the right, we actually don\u2019t see any impact associated with it. I think your second question is related to what happens specifically on Russia and Belarus and Ukraine. Since the Digital Media ARR, the book of business, we made the decision to reduce it. And so I think what you\u2019ll see on the data sheet is what our exiting Q1 ARR is and then another number which just takes out all of the existing book of business for those three countries. You see the impact on revenue certainly in Q2, Q3 and Q4 because what it means is the revenue that we would have been able to collect. But again, in the grand scheme of things, as you can see, it\u2019s fairly small as it relates to the business. So I think our targets, $440 million specifically, as you said, yes, it\u2019s impacted by the ARR business in those countries. But overall, business is strong and we feel optimistic. I think in many ways, the message really is that the new growth initiatives that both Dan and David talked to, they are starting to really show traction. And so we expect to see strength in the second half of the year and certainly beyond that.\nAlex Zukin: Got it. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Saket Kalia from Barclays.\nSaket Kalia: Okay, great. Hey, thanks for taking my question here. David, maybe for you. Great to see the Creative Cloud Express launch recently, I guess the question for you is, how do you feel the product differentiates from some of the competition out there? And maybe without going too deep, how do you plan on investing in that product specifically to continue your lead?\nDavid Wadhwani: Yes, thanks for the question. We\u2019re very excited about the launch of CCX. But just to up-level for a minute, and as a reminder for everyone on the call, we\u2019ve been talking about the communicator segment for years, both as it relates to non-pros and as it relates to the creator economy. We\u2019ve talked about in the past that our mobile and desktop apps have hundreds of millions of registrations, which is clearly going beyond our Creative Pro base. And we\u2019ve built a significant business. In fact, we believe that we\u2019re the largest provider of creative tools in the world when measured by revenue across all of our segments: pros, communicators and consumers. The introduction of Creative Cloud Express though represents a lot of our learning over the last few years, starting with the business model. It\u2019s a freemium business model. It\u2019s predominantly web and mobile. So it\u2019s zero friction for onboarding customers, and users are seeing success in minutes, not hours. In addition to that, we have an unprecedented library that we bring to Creative Cloud Express. We have 175 million stock images and videos. We have 20,000 fonts, largest font library online available, and thousands of templates that have been really carefully crafted and designed by some of the best creatives in the world. And this is important because at the end of the day, if you\u2019re going to be a content-first creation tool, the content you mix together is a fundamental differentiator in terms of what you\u2019re creating and what you\u2019re producing. And we feel very, very good and confident about our ability to continue to expand this library and just make sure that what people are mixing to create their output is world class. But of course, we also have the power of Adobe. If you look at what we\u2019re starting to do, and this gives you a hint of where we\u2019re going with our quick actions across Photoshop Quick Actions, Premiere Quick Actions, Acrobat Quick Actions that have started to make their way into Creative Cloud Express, we feel really good about the pipeline of innovation we can bring from our decades of leadership across all of our segments directly into Creative Cloud Express. And then, of course, we are looking for ways to accelerate. We acquired a company called ContentCal that we\u2019ve announced will be the foundation of rich content publishing and scheduling for Creative Cloud Express users. And then lastly, the work we\u2019ve been doing over the last many years around the data-driven operating model that Dan talked about in his opening has been invaluable here. So we\u2019re finding and we\u2019re onboarding new users that would not have typically interacted with Adobe through their intent-based search. And the result is a little bit of what we alluded to. We\u2019ve seen great traffic. We\u2019re seeing millions of monthly active users just a few months into the launch. We have an NPS over 60 at this point in the product. So we\u2019re really bullish on the start of where we are. And if you look at the long pipeline of Adobe-only innovation, maybe to your question, we\u2019re super excited about that. And the last thing I\u2019ll say here is that don\u2019t forget the opportunity here is to drive millions of new users into our franchise. But the opportunity is also to drive high engagement and usage within our core CC base and take what has already been a very, very strong retention curve there and continue to drive engagement and retention of our CC users as well.\nSaket Kalia: Very helpful. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.\nSterling Auty: Yes. Thanks. Hi, guys. Just maybe for clarification. With the changes, there is no update to the annual guidance. You typically don\u2019t, but I think investors want to understand how the impact on the negative side from the changes to ARR for Russia and Ukraine impact the annual guide versus the positive uplift that you\u2019ll get from the pricing structure. Thanks.\nShantanu Narayen: Yes. Sterling, I mean, I think color-wise, it\u2019s really still early in the year, but I feel great about the way we\u2019ve been navigating all of the external issues that have come. And it was a strong Q1. As we prepared for this call, we felt it was important to share with you the impact that we know of things, whether it\u2019s the revenue or ARR for Russia, what\u2019s happening on EPS as it relates to the tax rate as well as to provide some more of the growth drivers. But I net it out by saying while we are not updating the annual targets, as you pointed out, we\u2019re really optimistic on the significant number of growth drivers that we have. And we will share more throughout the year because we still are all navigating what is a considerably unpredictable situation. Our strong Q1, however, and the things that we control, we feel excellent about.\nSterling Auty: Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities.\nJay Vleeschhouwer: Thank you. Good evening. Shantanu, referring back to the analyst meeting 3 months ago, you and David used the term product-led growth. And I was wondering if you could elaborate on that because arguably, when you think about the company over the last 30 years or more, you\u2019ve always, in effect, been product-led growth. So how are you thinking about that differently now in terms of a concept or various executables for that? And then for Dan, could you talk about how you\u2019re thinking about your headcount growth relative to your expense growth for the year? You onboarded over 500 employees during the quarter, you finished Q1 with a record number of open recs. How are you thinking about filling those divisions, either to compensate for the increase in attrition you had in fiscal \u201821 versus normal organic growth that you otherwise would have done anyway?\nShantanu Narayen: Yes. Jay, when I think about the transformative things that we\u2019ve done in the company, certainly the move to subscriptions, the entrance into digital marketing, what we\u2019ve done with data-driven operating model to drive the sort of financial cadence of the business, they absolutely bubble to the top. But I would say those actually dwarf in comparison to the excitement that I feel about what product-led growth can continue to do. When you have hundreds of millions or billions of people using your software, a good example of what we\u2019ve done is the constant innovation that we\u2019re delivering on the Document Cloud side. And I think David referred to some of the statistics, whether it\u2019s sort of doubling what we see with web traffic and really being aware of the intent-based approach that people want when they come on the web to accomplish document actions, what we are doing in mobile and doubling it. And I think product-led growth just relates to ensuring that all of our product teams have information at their fingertips as to how people are really using it so that we can rapidly iterate in terms of what customers want and delight them. And I think on the Creative Cloud, to add to what David said to Saket as well, what that means with Creative Cloud Express is as you have these millions of users, we\u2019re constantly understanding where the search traffic is, how do you improve it. And it\u2019s just a new way of liberating all of the product-led \u2013 product teams to focus on what\u2019s truly important and truly needle-moving as far as customer interest and customer sentiment. And it\u2019s something that David has pioneered. So I\u2019ll have David add a little bit more. But I think the impact on how we serve customers, the NPS and being able to continue to recruit and retain is significant.\nDavid Wadhwani: Yes. I think Shantanu covered most of it. Just a couple of things to add. As you correctly point out, we joke internally that actually John and Chuck created product-led growth with distributing the free Reader and then sort of upselling people from there to the Acrobat offering. And so we\u2019ve, throughout our history, had this idea and sense of how you drive utilization and usage and engagement and then drive that to convert to users. I think what we are \u2013 where we are right now is an exciting inflection point where, as Shantanu mentioned, we\u2019re seeing a lot more activity and engagement on web, we\u2019re seeing a lot more activity and engagement on mobile. And that lets us have better and more seamless onboarding. So we can use everything we\u2019ve learned around DDOM to drive better intent-based search and reach audiences that frankly we weren\u2019t able to reach before because the onboarding experience, the actions to success and then what we do beyond that is in minutes, not hours.\nShantanu Narayen: Maybe one last thing before Dan comments. I think both Dan and David talked about retention and engagement during the quarter. And to give you a little bit more, Jay, color in terms of that, we look at churn rates. We look at reseller renewal. We look at 90-day cohort retentions. And in all of those, I think as a result of the activity that we\u2019re doing on the product teams to help improve, we\u2019re seeing improvement and getting to rates on all three of those that are better than they have ever been even prior to the pandemic. So I think that\u2019s, again, another example of what gives us confidence in our offerings and our innovation going forward.\nDan Durn: And then, Jay, just to come to your second question, we talked about the business performing well. When we talk about digital content and data increasingly driving economic growth going forward in a world where everything is going digital. That means we have an immense market opportunity in front of us, greater than $200 billion in 2024 and significantly larger than that as we look forward. So our long-term growth opportunity at Adobe is not opportunity-constrained. And so when we think about our leadership and product positions, they are built on the back of a very strong innovation engine at the company. So, we are going to orient towards growth. We are going to continue to invest in R&D and the sales muscle to scale our businesses over time and continue that leadership in the markets that we participate in. But we are going to do what we have always done along the way, is do it in a disciplined way, so we are marrying the investments we make with the opportunities as they materialize and grow in a very profitable way. And so you can see the company\u2019s history in terms of strong profitable growth, and I would expect our track record on that to continue over the long run.\nJay Vleeschhouwer: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.\nKeith Weiss: Thank you, guys for taking the question. I actually had a couple of clarifications I was hoping to ask you guys about. Shantanu, earlier in the call, you do made some comments about perhaps seeing a little bit of weakness in Europe at the end of the quarter. Can you dig in on that a little bit like where in the business, did you see that weakness? And did that persist into Q2, or was it just kind of more temperamental? So, that was number one. Number two, on the \u2013 I know we are not giving full year guidance, but when we think about the operating margin outperformance in Q1, is the commentary that that\u2019s going to be given back later in the year, or is it just like sort of the ramp-up gets pushed out, so the savings kind of like accrue throughout the full year? And then clarification number three, when you guys gave the original $1.9 billion net new ARR addition guidance for FY \u201822, did you guys already contemplate these price increases, so was the \u2013 or the price changes, were the price changes already in that $1.9 billion guide? So that\u2019s my three clarifications.\nShantanu Narayen: Sure. So, Keith, maybe I will answer the last question first and then talk about it, which is, as we were entering the year and what we talked at the FA meeting, if you actually \u2013 I think we also got a couple of questions as it relates to what we were going to do on pricing, and we alluded to the fact that we are constantly looking at it. And so while it was something that we were working on, we actually just pretty recently finished the entire effort. So, we didn\u2019t have it finalized, but we always thought that it was timed with the new offerings to actually look at the pricing structure as well. And so the definite amount and the materiality of that, we will know as we go through the process. But directionally, we knew that we were going to be looking at pricing more exhaustively. I think in terms of the clarification of what we saw, when the war broke out for the last couple of weeks, that impact is not just felt in Russia and Belarus and Ukraine, you see a little bit of that traffic across the region. So, that\u2019s really all I was alluding to. And we saw strength, and that strength continued in the U.S. right through the quarter. And so not unsurprisingly, we saw a little impact. So, that\u2019s all I was referring to as it related to the European situation. And did you have a third question, Keith?\nKeith Weiss: Yes, the third one was on operating margins.\nDan Durn: Yes. Your third question on operating margin. So, let me break it up into three time periods. Let\u2019s talk about Q1 briefly. Let\u2019s talk about FY \u201822 and then beyond. So, as we think about Q1, clearly, Omicron was a context around that quarter. So, our investments in things like travel, facilities weren\u2019t as robust as originally contemplated, and you saw a little bit of uplift from a margin structure standpoint in Q1. When we take a step back, we talked about the growth profile and the leadership of our product positions, continuing to invest to scale our businesses, and a lot of those investments being R&D and sales-oriented. We will continue to do that. And the targets that we set in FA Day a few months ago implied in those \u2013 in that framework is an operating margin for the year. And so I think you will see that unfold throughout the rest of the year. And then longer term, we talked about the significant opportunities facing the company and our ability to capture that with our leadership position as the world goes increasingly digital. And as we grow and scale this business, you will see the benefits of that over time layer into the operating margin as we continue to do it in a strong, profitable and disciplined way.\nKeith Weiss: Excellent. Thanks so much, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Tyler Radke with Citi.\nTyler Radke: Yes. Thanks very much for taking my question. Just going back to the price increase and pricing changes. Obviously, I am sure you will be sharing a lot more specifics as we go forward. But philosophically, just how are you thinking about the pricing changes at the high end versus the kind of entry-level creative products? And particularly, just curious how you are evaluating those pricing changes in the context of the competitive landscape? Thank you.\nShantanu Narayen: So, I think philosophically, the way we are looking at it, I will repeat what I said earlier, which is we haven\u2019t done a comprehensive look at that in multiple years. And directionally, I think the significant value that we have added has to do with people, whether you are in businesses or whether you are a user of the entire apps. I mean we continue to add new apps to the \u2013 what\u2019s called the CC All Apps platform. And directionally, we are just saying that is the area where we have to look at all of the increased value that we have. This is not driven in any way, shape or form by any competitive response. So, let me be categorical about that. This is raised by \u2013 we continue to attract billions of people to the platform in terms of the interest. And with all of the new offerings that we have, again as David said, across web, across mobile, across the browsers, we just want to make sure that as we continue to expand the offerings, we are looking at the pricing in a good way. So, the value that we have added to whether you are in teams with collaboration or whether you are to businesses continues to be a motivator for us to look at the prices as well on all the new apps that we have added. So hopefully, that gives you color. Let me also back up and say this is for us, all really about customers and delighting customers. But because we had an earnings call, we said as this gets rolled out, we at least want to give you some heads up because otherwise, some of you would say, why didn\u2019t you at least allude to it. As David said, this doesn\u2019t have an impact in Q2 really. It\u2019s a pretty small impact. So, that was the rationale and thinking associated with it. And we will certainly roll this out with customers first, and then we will share with you more of what the impact is. But that\u2019s the way we look at how we move the business going forward.\nTyler Radke: Great. And if I could sneak in a follow-up just on the digital experience side, obviously, pretty strong growth here in Q4 and the first part of the year, above 20% on an adjusted basis. I guess was there any kind of one-time factors that drove that outperformance? And as we think about the guide for the next quarter and the deceleration implied, just anything to call out there? Thank you.\nAnil Chakravarthy: Thanks for the question. We are pleased with the momentum we have seen in the digital experience business with 22% growth and subscription on an adjusted basis. The market opportunity is huge, over $100 billion of TAM. The pandemic obviously put a spotlight on it in terms of the urgency. We are seeing it continue to grow in terms of customer demand, customer interest at the Board level and at the C-level. We are in a really strong market position with what we have built with the Adobe Experience Platform and the native apps like Customer Journey Analytics and CDP that we have built with that. So, overall, we feel really excited about the path forward. And we just had the Summit conference last week, excellent pipeline building event as well as a chance to showcase our product innovation. So, we expect this to continue through the year in terms of our momentum.\nTyler Radke: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Keith Bachman with BMO.\nKeith Bachman: Hi. Thank you. I am going to follow lead with a couple of clarifications. Dan, could you comment on what the inorganic contribution was this quarter and where it manifests? So for instance Frame.io, what was the contribution there? Secondly, when you think about \u2013 I just want to clarify on the ARR write-off, so to speak. The comment was that you are ceasing all new incremental business. But are you going to continue to get ARR payments in Russia \u2013 or from Russia and Belarus from existing business that might actually contribute to ARR? Just a little bit confused on that one. And then in the spirit of Keith Weiss, I am actually going to ask a third clarification. Shantanu, in the past, you have said that in the creative side, new subscribers was the most significant contributor to growth. And I just wanted to try to understand given more competition perhaps in the lower end of the market, is that still true? Thank you.\nShantanu Narayen: I will answer the first \u2013 the third one first, Keith, as Dan does, which is if you look at the growth, the unit growth is being driven by single apps, which is new subscribers and driving to it. So that trend, in terms of continuing to drive single unit, is definitely part of how we think about it. I will answer maybe one part of also how you have to think about it, which is when you think about Russia and Belarus, we have the ARR, which is the book of business, but there is no way to really get payments. And with all of the sanctions that\u2019s there, what we have factored is that book of business, because we are not going to be getting payments from Russia, that is the impact that Dan alluded to, which is the $75 million for the rest of the year. So, in addition to seizing new payment \u2013 in addition to stopping new sales, what you have to realize is for a service that exists as a SaaS-based service, you are unable to collect payments. And so we have reflected that impact as well in the particular geographies.\nDan Durn: Yes. And just coming back to your last piece, Keith, on Frame, now, that it\u2019s part of the business, we are not going to be breaking this out. We talked about the momentum in the business. It\u2019s great. The team is doing really well. The number of deals, the average deal size, business has a lot of momentum around it. And we talked about the great collaboration technology that exists there. But now that it\u2019s a part of the business, we won\u2019t be breaking it out explicitly.\nKeith Bachman: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs.\nKash Rangan: Thank you very much. Congrats on the quarter. The numbers look quite good for Q1. So, Shantanu, I am curious, the shifting seasonality, generally when you find a more seasonal second half, that\u2019s generally a sign of maturity in the market or macro factors or just product transition factors. But when I look at your second half, you do have relatively easier comps for DM ARR, right? And then you have the pricing optimization. So, if we net it all out, how do you feel about the business in the second half relative to going into the first quarter, granted that we have all these macroeconomic concerns? But net of the positives against \u2013 net of the negatives against the positives, how do you feel today versus three months back about the rest of the fiscal year? Thank you so much.\nShantanu Narayen: Thanks, Kash. I mean to net it out, I definitely feel more positive about business moving forward than I ever have, because just if you take a step back and look at all of \u2013 first look at Q1, we had a strong Q1. We clearly beat our targets in what is perhaps the most unpredictable situations that exist in the world. So, we feel really good about Q1. We feel really good about the new initiatives that \u2013 both in Document Cloud and Creative Cloud and in Experience Cloud that David and Anil spoke to. I did allude to the fact that when you think about the seasonal cadence and the rhythm of the business, certainly, some of that\u2019s impacted. And perhaps the thing that you are alluding to, Kash, was in Q2 of last year, there was sort of a catch-up as \u201csmall and medium businesses\u201d came on \u2013 come back online. And so you have to just factor what that is in. But both in terms of the revenue growth in DME for Q3 and Q4 as it relates to getting more similar to Q1 as well as the ARR, we are optimistic about the second half. The only reason we didn\u2019t talk about Q2 is because we actually gave specific guidance and targets for Q2. So, don\u2019t take that as anything as opposed to we have given you targets for Q2 and we are trying to give you color on what happens in Q3 and Q4. So hopefully, that helps, Kash. And on the DX side, since there have been fewer questions on the DX side, I mean what we have done, Summit was really exciting, the amount of new announcements that we have done there. Every person that I talked to in the C-suite continues to want to really focus on digital transformation and customer experience management. I am excited. I am back on the road again. It feels great. We have employees back in the office and facilities. People want to meet, and digital engagement is top of mind. So, across all three of our businesses, we didn\u2019t talk about the document business. $100 million in ARR for the quarter, $2 billion book of business, really good adoption of our new functionality, whether it\u2019s on the web as well as a unifying sign with Acrobat, which was a big movement that we are trying to do. So, I think all of those are positive. I think the one impact that, again, maybe Dan can just touch on is certainly, it doesn\u2019t impact our core business. But the EPS, you just have to factor some of the revenue and other considerations that happened. But for the functional part of the business, I feel really good.\nDan Durn: Yes. So Shantanu did a good job talking about the fundamentals of the business. The other piece are the transient effects. And I would point to two of them. So, for the war in Ukraine, we de-risked the profile around the situation. And that\u2019s the prudent thing to do, to be conservative in situations like this. So, that\u2019s what you see in the $87 million reduction in ARR as well as the $75 million reduction from a revenue standpoint, Q2 through Q4. So, if I take that revenue and I flow it through the P&L, that\u2019s going to be about a $0.04 a share headwind per quarter for the balance of the year, Q2 through Q4. From a tax standpoint, we talked about an 18.5% non-GAAP tax rate. That\u2019s a 1.5 point change versus where we were at FA Day. If I were to roll that through the P&L, that\u2019s about $0.06 a share per quarter throughout the year. We were able to overcome that in Q1. And then when I look at the share repurchase activity, clearly the company took advantage of the current environment. And that\u2019s going to create about a $0.02 a share benefit each quarter this year versus where we were at FA Day. And so when I net all of that out on a go-forward basis, you have got about an $0.08 per share headwind in each quarter. And again, like we said in Q1, we were able to overcome that headwind in Q1 and deliver above the expectations that we had set, and we are going to continue to orient towards growth. We are going to invest to lead, but if there is opportunities to do it in a disciplined way and overcome it on a go-forward basis, we will take it a quarter at a time and let you know what we see.\nKash Rangan: Thank you, Dan. And Shantanu, just one final follow-up, the clear \u2013 I know that you want to talk about the Document Cloud and the Experience Cloud, but I remember fall of 2011, you have made a very bold transition to Creative Cloud subscription. You, in fact, outlined that you have a target of 4 million subscribers in fiscal \u201815, which seemed quite visionary back then, right? So, as you look at the inflection point going \u2013 the company is going through, what are your aspirations for Creative Cloud Express if you were to measure it in subscribers or how big of a business would you like it to be? What would be your similar prognostication as you look into the next few years? And that\u2019s it for me. Thank you so much.\nShantanu Narayen: Kash, at the FA meeting, we talked about what the overall addressable market opportunity is. But I really feel like we can get billions of users to use our product. And then they will be the spectrum of people who will be paying us on a subscription business as well as others who will perhaps take advantage of some of the freemium offerings that we have. We are starting to see that kind of adoption with the Document Cloud certainly, right, where you have 0.5 billion people who have used our \u2013 a Reader and other products. But I think in terms of Creative Cloud Express, my hope and my aspiration is that every single person who has a story to tell uses some part of the Creative Cloud Express. We are off to a great start there, Kash. I think on the differentiation, as David said, we have the platform. We have every single piece of technology that we need to deliver a great compelling experience. And now we are also world-class at making sure that we capture search-based intent. So, we want to anticipate what people want to do with Creative, but I would be disappointed if that doesn\u2019t just continue to be a huge growth area in terms of new users to our platform.\nJonathan Vaas: Operator, we are a little past the top of the hour. We will squeeze in one more question and then wrap up. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo Securities.\nMichael Turrin: Hi there. Good afternoon. Appreciate you squeezing me on. We have been expecting a return to normal expense profile. Q1 operating margins were actually flat relative to last year. Anything else you can add just around the Q1 margin results? And as we think through the puts and takes between that return to a more normalized expense profile and some of the product and pricing efforts you have mentioned ahead this year, any way to think through if price uplift can help offset some of that expense normalization you are expecting? Thank you.\nDan Durn: Yes, sure. So, if I were to look at where we landed in Q1, and we talked about not fully investing from a travel and facilities standpoint because of the Omicron environment. And as I look forward to the Q2 guide and the operating margin that is implicit in that guide and I were to break it out into some several buckets. There is going to be an influence from the transient effects of the Russia situation. We are going to do increased hiring to invest for future growth. We get full quarter impact from a merit standpoint instead of a one month impact. And then we will start to see the reopening expenses start to layer back in. Those are the four buckets that bridge you from Q1 to Q2. And I would say each of those four buckets is roughly equally weighted. And so I think that\u2019s what gets you to a more normalized run rate as we look into Q2 and the back half of the year.\nShantanu Narayen: And since that was the last question, I wanted to, again, thank you all for joining us today. We are pleased with the performance. We think we had a really strong start to the fiscal year across all three of our businesses Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and Experience Cloud. And more than that, I think our ability to continue to delight customers and deliver on the innovative roadmap gives us a lot of confidence associated with the new initiatives taking stock and contributing to the future growth at Adobe. The spotlight, I believe, on digital will just continue. And as we get back to more normalcy, I think that will only all go well for both Adobe and our customers. And the successful Summit that we just organized, I think is another indicator of the interest that exists in our solutions. So, thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to sharing more as we go through the year. Thank you.\nJonathan Vaas: This concludes the call. Thanks, everyone.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today\u2019s conference. We thank you all for your participation.
