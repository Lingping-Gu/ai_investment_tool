I\u2019m joined by our Chief Financial Officer, David Lamont.  I want to start by acknowledging the tragic loss of life of one of our team members, Jody Byrne, in our rail operations at Port Hedland, the week before last. My deepest sympathies go out to his family and friends, as well as his colleagues. We are supporting them in any way we can at this difficult time.  We have commenced our investigation, the findings of which will be implemented thoroughly. Safety is our number one priority. Nothing matters more. We have been intensely focused on eliminating fatalities from BHP but, as this terrible incident so tragically reminds us, safety requires constant vigilance and we are redoubling our efforts. We will not rest in our efforts to ensure no one gets harmed while at work at BHP.  We continued to execute our strategy during the half and maintained operational rigour in the face of challenging external circumstances. We\u2019ve again delivered steady and reliable operating performance, supporting our ability to consistently deliver attractive shareholder returns and to increase our investment in growth. We\u2019re also continuing to optimise our portfolio.  We\u2019ve added to and accelerated our exposure to future facing commodities -- the minerals critical to the energy transition, including through our offer for OZ Minerals. And with our joint venture partner, we\u2019ve started to pursue options to divest the Daunia and Blackwater mines. This will further concentrate our coal portfolio on the highest-quality metallurgical coals for steelmaking. These higher-quality coals support more efficient blast furnace operations and lower relative emissions intensity.  I\u2019ll ask David to speak about the financials in detail shortly, but first I\u2019d like to share some highlights from the last six months. Our teams have delivered steady and reliable operational performance. We achieved record half-year production at Western Australia Iron Ore, supported by strong performance right across the supply chain. Copper production rose, as Escondida accessed higher grade ore; the Spence concentrator continued to ramp up; and Olympic Dam extended its recent track record of operational stability. And BMA, while impacted by recent wet weather, demonstrated improvements in underlying productivity.  Our continued focus on operational excellence and cost control has helped us to contain the impacts of inflation on our cost base. But we\u2019re far from complacent, and are keeping a close eye on costs. So despite severe weather in Eastern Australia, commodity price and inflationary headwinds, and labor availability challenges, our continued resilient performance has delivered earnings of more than $13 billion, and enabled us to announce a dividend of $0.90 per share for the half year. That\u2019s $4.6 billion that flows back to all of our investors.  We\u2019ve also continued to generate social value for and with those around us, governments, our workforce, our suppliers, our customers, and the communities where we operate. The creation of social value is essential to better business outcomes and long-term shareholder value, because it supports stable operations and reduces risk to the business. It also opens the door to future opportunities, partnerships, capital and talent. The value we create includes the taxes and royalties we\u2019ve paid.  This half, we paid $7.5 billion in taxes and royalties, which support government budgets and pay for essential infrastructure and services. In fact, last year, in Australia, BHP paid close to 10% of all the nation\u2019s corporate tax, a figure that reflects the importance of our success to the national economy.  We also made substantial contributions via wages, community contributions and local procurement, contributions that are supporting lives, livelihoods, and regional development. Everything that BHP earns ultimately gets distributed, to governments, to local businesses and suppliers, to employees, and to our shareholders, including, around 70% of all Australians who benefit through their direct BHP shareholdings or superannuation funds.  On operational greenhouse gas emissions, we\u2019re on track to meet our target of at least a 30% reduction by the 2030 financial year, including through our recent signings of power purchase agreements for renewable electricity at Olympic Dam and Port Hedland. And we continue to focus on reducing our use of fresh water, through innovation and investment in desalination. We\u2019ve increased female representation across the Group to more than 33%, a near doubling since we announced our aspirational goal to achieve a gender balanced workforce back in 2016.  And pleasingly, we also released our updated Indigenous Peoples Policy Statement during the half. This statement strengthens our commitment to working with Indigenous Peoples to support reconciliation and contribute to better social, economic and environmental outcomes. Over the last six months, we\u2019ve more than doubled our spend with Indigenous suppliers from the previous December half, including through an agreement with a Banjima-owned and operated business, to operate and maintain one of our semi-mobile crushers in the Pilbara. This agreement not only provides employment opportunities, but helps build long-term business capacity.  These efforts align with our Social Value Framework, which we announced in June last year, we\u2019re using the framework to hardwire social value into every level of decision making across our global operations.  David will now take you through the financial results from the half year. \nDavid Lamont: Thanks, Mike. We have delivered another strong set of results, despite a more challenging backdrop, with lower prices and other external pressures. Underlying attributable profit was $6.6 billion, or $1.30 per share, one of our top half year results. This incorporates an effective tax rate, including royalties, of $0.40. Underlying EBITDA remained very healthy at $13.2 billion. And our margin, at 54%, and return on capital employed, at 29%, remained strong, reflecting the quality and resilience of our assets, and consistent operating performance.  Over the half, we spent $3 billion on capital and exploration expenditure. Our full year guidance remains unchanged at $7.6 billion. As always, we remain disciplined and guided by our Capital Allocation Framework. Our shareholders continue to benefit from our consistent and reliable performance. As Mike mentioned, our interim dividend is $0.90 per share, fully franked, which is the fifth highest ordinary dividend ever.  Digging into the details, the EBITDA waterfall highlights the significant impact of lower commodity prices, by far the biggest driver of the period-on-period decline in earnings. Iron ore and copper, our two largest segments, saw prices down 25%, and 19%, respectively, from the December 2021 half. As expected, we continue to see the lagged effect of inflation. This had a negative $1 billion impact this half, which equates to an effective rate of around 12%. The most significant impact was in diesel, although we do see some relief in the second half as prices have recently come off their peak.  The favourable impacts of the weaker Australian dollar and Chilean peso against the US dollar were only a partial offset to inflation. Beyond these external pressures, I am pleased that we have delivered well against the areas within our control. Due to strong performance at our iron ore and copper assets, higher volumes delivered an increase of $700 million. And we managed controllable costs well, with inventory movements accounting for the majority of the $500 million increase. These inventory movements were mainly driven by the planned drawdown of stocks at Olympic Dam as we processed stocks built during the prior period ahead of the major smelter maintenance campaign.  Inventory also reduced at Western Australia Iron Ore, Nickel West and BMA, largely as a consequence of wet weather and labor availability challenges. The $400 million sitting in the Other category largely reflects lower recovery of freight costs caused by movements in the freight index, and the lower profit at Antamina mainly due to the lower copper price.  Over the past five years, we have consistently delivered EBITDA margins above 50%, with iron ore above 60%, and copper above 45%. Underpinned by record production, Western Australia Iron Ore delivered an EBITDA of $7.6 billion at a 65% margin. We delivered strong performance across the supply chain, and the ongoing ramp-up at South Flank is increasing the average quality of our product. With C1 costs of $15.50 per tonne, up only 5%, we have extended our lead as the lowest cost major producer.  In Copper, our EBITDA margin remains very healthy at 44%. Escondida\u2019s production increased by 5%, with concentrator feed grade up seven percentage points from the prior December half. While unit costs increased, reflecting the inflationary environment, these increases are below what others in the industry are experiencing.  Our other copper assets also performed well. Olympic Dam\u2019s ongoing strong performance saw near-record material processed and record gold production, while the Spence concentrator continued to ramp up. At BMA, coal production was up 5%. Despite significantly more rain, higher productivity on dry days allowed us to do almost the same amount of stripping as last year. The increase in unit costs largely reflects inflationary pressures and a significant draw down on mine inventories, partly in order to capture the high price environment in the period, rather than the traditional build in the half.  In Nickel, our EBITDA margin was lower, largely due to unfavourable inventory movements, inflationary pressures, and the downtime at the refinery following planned maintenance. And at New South Wales Energy Coal, while benefitting from record prices, conditions remain very challenging. Volumes were down significantly due to the wettest half in six decades. And this, plus inflation, contributed to sharply higher unit costs, to just over $100 or around A$150 per tonne in the half.  At Jansen, Stage 1 is now 16% complete, and is progressing on time and on budget. We now expect capital expenditure this financial year of around $860 million, up $120 million, largely due to the accelerated production schedule. So stepping back, we continue to perform well, both operationally and on the cost front. As expected, we are seeing the impact of inflation across our global supply chains, as well as labor availability challenges, particularly in the Australian operations. That said, with our ongoing focus on productivity and controllable costs, we are managing these external headwinds extremely well.  Thank you and I\u2019ll now hand back over to Mike \nMike Henry : Thank you, David. I\u2019d like now to take you through how we see the outlook for the commodities we produce, and what we\u2019re doing to position and grow our portfolio. Over the course of this calendar year, we expect three key themes to play out. We expect to see a slowing of growth in Europe and the US, as the lagged impacts of last year\u2019s anti-inflation policies and the energy crisis continue to flow through.  Conversely, China\u2019s reopening is progressing well, with positive social and economic signposts emerging. Bank lending, mobility data, new home prices and business surveys are all showing solid signs of improvement in early calendar 2023. The pent-up demand being released as China opens back up from the COVID lock-downs, coupled with growth-promoting policies such as the support for the housing market, are expected to drive stronger economic growth and increased demand for the commodities we produce.  We said in August that we believe that China will be a stabilising force for global growth over the remainder of this year and we now have even greater conviction in this view. Finally, while it varies by region, an easing of global inflation may allow central banks to end their rate tightening cycles in the coming quarters. As such, we expect world growth will strengthen in 2024. As always, there are many moving parts in the near-term. However, it\u2019s fair to say that the economic picture is clearer now than it was 6 to 12 months ago.  We remain very confident in the long-term demand for commodities, driven by the global trends playing out around us. The fundamentals that underpin our strategy are unchanged, supplying metals and minerals the world will need for a growing population, increasing standards of living, and the energy transition. We have world class assets in commodities we confidently expect to be in strong demand for decades to come.  By 2050, the world is projected to be home to around 10 billion people, that\u2019s 2 billion more than today. Those 10 billion people will need more efficient food production from less arable land, supporting demand for potash for fertiliser. On current estimates, more than 2 billion of them will drive electric cars. That\u2019s about 100 times current figures. So that means more copper and nickel. 7 billion of them will likely live in urban areas, 2.5 billion more than today, which means steel for construction and infrastructure. And that takes iron ore and higher-quality metallurgical coal.  And to power it all with lower carbon emissions, an enormous increase in global energy production from wind and solar will be needed, meaning more copper, more steel. I\u2019ve talked before about the magnitude of the increase in key commodities, copper, nickel and steel -- that both traditional demand drivers, and decarbonisation, will require. So we believe the long-term demand outlook is clear and enduring. But there will be significant challenges in meeting it, the lack of new discoveries of attractive large-scale deposits, land and water scarcity, changing societal expectations, and difficulty in securing permits to operate or expand in some jurisdictions.  Our portfolio is built to compete in this complex, but opportunity-rich environment. We have the largest copper endowment, and the second largest nickel sulphide resource, globally. We are a leading producer of both iron ore and higher-quality metallurgical coal for steelmaking. And we have plans to be a globally significant potash supplier. So as demand for these essential commodities rises, BHP, as an incumbent, large-scale producer; and with the size and quality of our assets, balance sheet, and proven operational excellence, has an embedded advantage.  So we\u2019re ready to do our part to supply the world with the commodities it needs. And in turn we are seeing a growing understanding of these needs globally. Indeed, over the past two years there has been a growing awareness of the essential nature of these minerals to the energy transition. And with that we\u2019ve seen an increase in policies that will support responsible and sustainable mining to meet the growth in demand, and governments around the world are seeking to work with business to speed up approvals processes and ensure attractive investment settings.  We are a global company with numerous options to deploy our capital. Every project has to compete against other proposals from all of our global assets on a range of metrics; resource quality, technical risk, commodity outlook, capital expenditure, expected returns, as well as the fiscal competitiveness and stability, and sovereign risk of the regions in which we are looking to invest. And we continue to allocate our capital accordingly.  I\u2019d like to mention two projects in regions where we are investing for growth, Western Australia Iron Ore, and the Jansen potash project in Canada. WAIO is an incredible asset. Over many years, we\u2019ve been removing bottlenecks so we can get more of our iron ore onto more ships at Port Hedland, and do it safely, reliably, and cost effectively. We have plans in place to grow production to more than 300 million tonnes per year in the medium term. This is low capital intensity, highly efficient growth. And we\u2019re studying options to grow beyond this, to 330 million tonnes per annum.  As always, we prioritise the pursuit of valuable growth. At Jansen, the $5.7 billion Stage 1 project is running to plan. We\u2019ve awarded $2.5 billion in contracts, engineering is now over 80% complete, and 85% of procurement orders have been placed, giving us confidence in our plans and schedule. We now expect first production in late calendar year 2026 as progress to date has enabled us to accelerate procurement contracts and bring forward mobilisation of key contractors to site.  We have also poured first concrete ahead of schedule, and advanced the foundations for our Stage 1 mill, thanks to an extended summer season last year. We\u2019ve also accelerated Jansen Stage 2 studies. We now expect to complete the feasibility study in the 2024 financial year, a year earlier than we\u2019ve said previously, giving us additional optionality on when we bring these tonnes to market.  We\u2019re always looking at how we can grow further value from our assets, and we\u2019ve got a number of organic options across our portfolio, including in future facing commodities. That\u2019s important, because we\u2019re aiming to have half of our portfolio made up of future facing commodities by 2030. In the near term, we\u2019re accelerating studies across our copper assets. At Escondida and Pampa Norte in Chile, we\u2019re looking at options to add to production, including through both our concentrator strategy, and leaching technologies which would help us extract more copper, either through reprocessing ore or unlocking ore that can\u2019t be recovered using conventional methods.  And in South Australia, we are studying the optimal growth pathway for Olympic Dam, including a two-stage smelter which would deconstrain mining operations. Oak Dam is feeding into this thinking as well, and after a further 40 kilometres of drilling since May 2021 we have been able to better define the extent of the mineralisation and we continue to see encouraging results. And of course, the OZ Minerals assets would provide access to additional production, and growth options.  While organic growth will always be a clear focus, we have additional growth levers at our disposal. Exploration, which is about finding new deposits; early-stage entry, where we get in on the ground floor with smaller miners, and bring our skills and scale to bear on a project to help it grow; as well as technology and innovation, which we use to get better and more efficient at what we do, and to unlock more of our incredible resources.  We are taking active steps to create and accelerate longer-term options. I\u2019ll highlight three of those today where we are taking innovative approaches; exploration, BHP Ventures, and BHP Xplor. While in the context of BHP these are relatively small investments, they are highly strategic, and in time we hope that they will become meaningful contributors.  Firstly, exploration. We\u2019re increasing exploration efforts, building our team, and increasing our spend. This is a significant focus area for us. We\u2019re seeking new targets in mature terrains through applying new technologies; prioritizing greenfield exploration for both copper and nickel, and we\u2019re actively growing and expanding into new jurisdictions, as we\u2019ve shown with our recent agreement with Mundoro, covering three exploration projects in Serbia.  Secondly, BHP Ventures, our own venture capital arm, where we\u2019ve screened more than 1,200 opportunities and built a high-quality global portfolio of over 20 holdings in just three years -- five of those in the last half. Ventures is focused on emerging technologies that can help grow and improve our existing operations, our resource base, and our value chain. This includes via new sub-surface exploration techniques using artificial intelligence through KoBold Metals, or supporting the potential to reduce Scope 3 emissions from steel making, through electrolysis companies like Boston Metals and Electra.  And third, through BHP Xplor, which merges concepts from venture capital and early-stage accelerators. We announced Xplor in August 2022 and had hundreds of applications from all around the world, focused on exploration and discovery of copper, nickel and other critical minerals. We\u2019ve now selected seven companies, and we\u2019ll provide funding and support to accelerate their growth, and potentially partner with them.  Our approach is innovative, fast-paced and disruptive. We have to be. The industry must be willing to take more risks, in deploying innovative technologies, to supply the needs of the energy transition.  Before I conclude, I\u2019ll touch just briefly on the progress of our proposed acquisition of OZ Minerals. We only pursue acquisitions where we believe we can create value for our shareholders. We believe the proposal we\u2019ve put to OZ Minerals represents highly compelling value for shareholders on both sides. The OZ Minerals Board has recommended it unanimously.  OZ Minerals will increase our exposure to copper, uranium and nickel, all of which are important for the energy transition. It has a compelling growth pipeline, and there are attractive potential synergies, including through the proximity to our existing assets. This is a good company run by good management, and they\u2019ve unlocked substantial value so far. We intend to retain the vast majority of OZ Minerals\u2019 workforce, and bring together the best from both companies in terms of culture and approach. While their recent results demonstrate that OZ is under the same inflationary pressures as everyone else, this is no surprise, and we believe BHP can, over time, unlock even greater value.  OZ Minerals expects to distribute more information to its shareholders in a scheme booklet in early March, to hold their scheme meeting for their shareholders to vote on the scheme in April, with implementation in either late April or early May. We think the OZ Minerals assets are a good fit for BHP, and we look forward to reporting further on the transaction as it progresses.  In summary, BHP continues to deliver the strong and consistent performance, and attractive returns, that our stakeholders have come to expect. And the future couldn\u2019t be more exciting. Our strategy is simple. We have built a portfolio of world class assets, low cost, with options to expand and we operate them very well. We are disciplined on cost and capital, and we have a long-standing commitment to social value.  As the global population grows, as urbanisation increases, and as the world pursues a low-emissions energy transition, our portfolio is set up for success. Copper, nickel, potash, iron ore, and higher-quality metallurgical coal for steelmaking, all vital to the future. While what we produce is essential, how we manage our business has never been more important, more sustainably, and in a way that creates enduring, mutual benefit for those that support and rely on us, our people, partners, the economy, the environment, indigenous partners, local communities and shareholders.  To do this we remain focused on operational excellence, cost and capital discipline, and delivering value and returns. BHP remains strongly positioned to create value now and into the future. Thank you. \nQ - :"}, {"symbol": "BHP", "quarter": 4, "year": 2022, "date": "2022-08-17 01:30:00", "content": "Mike Henry: Hello, and thank you for joining us today to hear about BHP's results for the 2022 financial year. I'm joined by our Chief Financial Officer, David Lamont, who will take us through the financial details shortly. First, though, I'd like to mention some highlights from the year. BHP delivered a record set of results for the year, continuing our track record of strong performance. Our assets overcame multiple challenges to deliver solid operational performance demonstrating the resilience of our business. Most importantly, we had another fatality for a year. And we did what we said we would do making significant progress on reshaping our portfolio to deliver value now and into the future. We merged our Petroleum business with Woodside, capturing value and providing choice for shareholders. We completed the sales of our interest in Cerrejon and BMC, further focusing our coal portfolio on higher-quality coals for steelmaking. We unified our corporate structure, making us simpler and more agile. We approved the Jansen Stage 1 potash project in Canada, giving us a pipeline of high-quality growth in what is an exciting future-facing commodity. We're accelerating studies for growth, including Jansen Stage 2 and Western Australian Iron Ore to 330 million tonnes per annum. And we continue to take action on climate. We have a differentiated proven approach to growing value. This is reflected in the quality of our portfolio that saw a rise in earnings in the second half of the financial year, unlike many others in the sector as well as our approach to social value and how we bring together our people and culture, systems and processes and ways of working. We remain unwavering in our efforts to improve safety and protect our people, and it is thanks to that clear prioritization and its application by our workforce and leaders that we have now gone more than 3.5 years without a fatality. We are also experiencing fewer high-potential injuries, those that could cause significant injury or fatality, which is a leading indicator of our safety performance. Our strong focus on safety and health includes our work towards the elimination of sexual harassment, racism and bullying from BHP. We have continued to take strong action, making upgrades to security and accommodation villages, enhancing training programs including for both leaders and bystanders, and improving support services. I want to take this opportunity to thank our people and our stakeholders for their ongoing feedback and recommendations. Their insights continue to inform our approach. We know we have more work to do, and we are determined to make continued progress and ensure BHP is safe and inclusive for everyone. I mentioned the challenging circumstances of the year. To be specific, we continue to experience the disruption and uncertainty of the pandemic. We saw the Ukraine crisis exacerbate global supply chain pressures, and we experienced inflation impacts across our portfolio. Managing uncertainty and risk is a core part of our business, and our people and approach have allowed us to address these additional challenges in a disciplined way. This, along with our focus on operational excellence, the quality of our assets and our leading approach to social value means that we remain better positioned to protect and consistently deliver strong results through the cycle. We've delivered well against production and unit cost guidance. We achieved record shipments from our Iron Ore business in Western Australia for the third year running, and we remain the world's lowest cost major producer. In copper, Escondida in Chile had record material mine and near record concentrator throughput while Olympic Dam in South Australia performed strongly in the fourth quarter after planned smelter maintenance. I'm very proud of the way people across BHP have united to deliver such a strong safety and operational performance in the face of the challenges in the external environment. Our sector-leading performance confirms my belief that our people and the way we work are a defining feature of our business and a substantial competitive advantage. This strong and reliable performance enabled us to capture the benefits of high commodity prices and deliver record underlying EBITDA of almost $41 billion. This has allowed us to return a record $16.4 billion in ordinary dividends to shareholders over the past 12 months. Now these are important figures, but they are only one part of our overall contribution to the lives and livelihoods of people around the world through employment, through supplier relationships, through community support and through royalties and taxation. The scale of our contribution supports economies, power small and large businesses and helps to fund services and infrastructure in the nations where we operate. During the year, BHP's total economic contribution was $78 billion, which includes a record $17.3 billion paid to governments, up over 50% year-on-year and more than our dividends to shareholders. BHP continues to deliver social value where we operate. Creating social value isn't a byproduct of our business. It's a core aim, planning and operating in a way that delivers long-term sustainable value and opportunity for BHP, our shareholders and the broader community. We see it in our commitment to the environment. We've lowered our operational greenhouse gas emissions by 24% over the past 2 years, mostly through increased uptake of renewable energy. And we've built on our research and development partnerships in steelmaking and maritime. This works towards the goals and targets detailed in our climate transition action plan, which received strong support from shareholders at our last AGM. And we've reduced our reliance on freshwater. Through efficiency initiatives and desalinization, freshwater withdrawals are down almost 30% since 2017, nearly double our target. We also continue to make strong progress on making our teams more inclusive and more diverse because we know these teams are stronger performing. Our workforce is now over 32% female, and that number continues to rise. I'll hand over to David now to detail our financial results.\nDavid Lamont: Thanks, Mike. This was a very strong result, even more so given the backdrop of the challenging operating environment. Excluding Petroleum, underlying EBITDA was up 16% to $40.6 billion and at a record margin of 65%. After an effective tax rate, including royalties of 38.5%, underlying attributable profit was $21.3 billion. And underlying earnings per share increased by 25% to a record $0.0421 per share. Our total attributable profit was $30.9 billion, including petroleum and a net exceptional gain of $7.1 billion after tax, comprising a gain on the merger of our Petroleum business with Woodside of $8.2 billion, a gain on the disposal of BMC of $840 million, partly offset by a charge for the Samarco dam failure of $1.1 billion plus unification-related transaction costs and an impairment of U.S. deferred tax assets of $851 million. To ensure shareholders again benefited from our strong performance, we've announced a final dividend of $0.0175 per share, taking our full year ordinary dividend to a record $0.0325 per share. EBITDA benefited from higher prices for most of our core commodities. Metallurgical and energy coal prices were more than triple that of last year. Copper and nickel prices were up by 9% and 43%, respectively. These were partly offset by lower, although still very healthy iron ore prices. The favorable impacts of the weaker Australian dollar and Chilean peso against the U.S. dollar helped to offset general inflation and commodity input cost pressures. It's worth noting that the transition towards fully renewable power at Escondida and Spence generated more than $100 million in cost savings this year. On the controllable side of the ledger, volumes were lower, driven by the planned smelter maintenance at Olympic Dam, lower copper grade at Escondida, significant weather impacts at BMA and the impacts of COVID across the group, partly offsetting by ongoing strong operating performance at Western Australian Iron Ore and the ramp-up of the new concentrator at Spence. On the cost front, we continue to perform well. Controllable cash costs increased by just $540 million, with more than 50% of this associated with COVID, which were treated as exceptional in the prior year. The $1.7 billion increase from ceased and sold operations primarily reflects the strong performance of BMC until the completion of the sale. These results continue our track record of strong and consistent performance. We have again delivered margins above our peer group, giving us greater through the cycle resilience and producing a high baseline of cash flows. We've delivered net operating cash flows of more than $15 billion again this year, extending this track record to all but one of the past 13 years. We've achieved this due to the quality of our portfolio and our focus on operational excellence and cost discipline, despite market and operating conditions varying greatly over these years. This stability is a hallmark for us with few businesses in our sector having delivered this consistently. Across the portfolio, our underlying operations performed well. We delivered well against the production and unit cost guidance despite the COVID and inflationary impacts. And all of our segments, except Nickel West, delivered EBITDA margins in excess of 50%. Western Australian Iron Ore continued to perform strongly with EBITDA of $21.7 billion at a 71% margin, underpinned by record sales volumes of 284 million tonnes. The ramp-up of South Flank to full capacity is ahead of schedule with, on average, a rate of 67 million tonnes delivered in the June quarter. In copper, the increase in EBITDA to $8.6 billion was driven by higher realized prices, partly offset by lower volumes and inflation. Despite significant wet weather impacts and labor constraints, BMA achieved a $5.8 billion increase in EBITDA and a 62% margin with average realized prices more than 3x the prior period. And New South Wales Energy Coal generated record EBITDA of almost $2 billion as it increased its proportion of washed coals to capture record price premiums. Higher quality coals now make up almost 90% of sales compared to approximately 60% last year. So we continue to perform well overall, both operationally and on the cost front. That said, we're acutely aware that the lag effects of inflation and labor availability are challenges we continue to deal with. While we anticipate higher unit costs across our major assets over the next 12 months, we expect to maintain our advantaged cost position, aided by our world-class assets, differentiated approach to operational excellence and continued relentless focus on cost discipline. Now turning to capital expenditure. As Mike spoke to, we are accelerating growth. CapEx is expected to increase over the medium term as we said it would, and about 60% of that will go towards future-facing commodities namely copper, nickel and potash. One of the great strengths of BHP is our ability to invest through the cycle. Over the next 2 years, the majority of funds will be allocated to maintenance and improvement capital. Maintenance capital will increase by around $1 billion by 2024 as we invest to continue our reliable operational performance. This includes over $500 million of operational decarbonization capital. Improvement capital includes projects that enable improved productivity, quality facilities and organizational culture. In terms of major projects, spend at Jansen will increase near term to approximately $740 million in 2023. Other projects across the group include capital-efficient debottlenecking works in iron ore, plant modifications at Spence and studies on options at Escondida. As we look to the medium term, the increase in spend relates to future-facing commodities. This includes continued spend on Jansen Stage 1 and potentially Stage 2, and growth options in copper at Escondida, Spence, Olympic Dam as well as in Nickel. Mike will touch more on these projects we are looking to study and looking to accelerate later on. We will also spend on our steelmaking commodities, which remain important for the energy transition. Getting Western Australian Iron Ore to 300-plus million tonnes per annum in the medium term will require an acceleration of sustaining mine development and continued capital-efficient debottlenecking works. Studies are also underway for our 330 million tonne per annum option. Combined, we expect annual capital expenditure and exploration expenditure of around $10 billion over the medium term. Of course, all investment decisions will be subject to our capital allocation framework, which has served us well since it was put in place in 2016. We have built a very strong balance sheet that can withstand external shocks and market volatility while reinvesting in the business to accelerate future options and deliver very substantial returns to shareholders. Reflecting our strong performance, we generated record operating cash flows of more than $29 billion for the year. Our balance sheet is in an outstanding position with net debt of $333 million. Off the back of our strong results, we have announced a final dividend of $8.9 billion, which takes our full year dividend to more than $16 billion. In addition, we distributed $19.6 billion as an in-specie dividend through the merger of our Petroleum business with Woodside. All in, we distributed over $15 billion in franking credits this financial year. With that, I'll hand back to Mike for an update on the business.\nMike Henry: Thanks, David. Amid the complexity and volatility of the external environment, we see significant opportunity for BHP. In the year ahead, China's stimulus policies are expected to contribute positively to growth. Infrastructure in the automotive sector are already responding. However, a rebound in housing activity is expected to take longer. The potential for further lockdowns, of course, remains a source of uncertainty. Outside China, the conflict in Ukraine, the unfolding energy crisis in Europe, high inflation and policy tightening in response to this are expected to result in an overall slowing of global growth. The effects of inflation are expected to continue through next year as well tightness in labor markets and challenging supply chain conditions. While the external environment is complex, BHP is well positioned to outperform in these conditions. Our ongoing focus on productivity and continuous improvement stand us in good stead. Over and above this, our experience and capability in managing through previous cycles and track record of early and decisive action gives us confidence we can successfully navigate current market volatility. As David has explained, we have done well to minimize the effects of inflation this last year, and we intend to do better than others going forward. And as inflationary pressures continue to lift and steepen operating cost curves, low-cost operators like BHP stand to capture higher relative margins. And our scale, global procurement function and network of trusted partners means that with supply chain disruptions occur, we can quickly adapt and continue to prosper where others may not. None of these complexities alter the positive fundamentals that underpin our business. The realities of climate change remain. The world still needs to decarbonize, and the infrastructure requirements for that are immense. The world's population will continue to grow, urbanize and demand higher standards of living, and that means the demand for our commodities will continue to grow. Under BHP's Paris-aligned 1.5-degree scenario, our modeling shows considerable growth in global demand for the commodities we produce. BHP has some of the best assets in the world to meet that demand: Escondida, the world's largest copper mine, providing BHP with the world's largest copper endowment when taken together with our other copper assets; Western Australian Iron Ore, the world's lowest cost major iron ore business; Nickel West, the second largest nickel sulfide resource in the world; BMA, a leading supplier of higher-quality coals for steelmaking; and Jansen in Canada, which marks our entry into the world's best potash basin and opens up significant growth potential. These assets provide a strong platform for growth. But for us to fully capture this, it's essential we also create mutual value for the communities, governments and partners that support us. In June, we released our new social value framework to help guide our actions for the greatest mutual value. Our aim with social value is to be deliberate and proactive in taking into account social and financial impact in the choices we make. By prioritizing both, we can create mutual benefit for our stakeholders and deliver long-term value for our shareholders. In doing so, we build better relationships that help us gain insight to better understand, manage and avoid risks. These relationships bring opportunities to work creatively and collaboratively, which unlocks different ways of thinking. And through this, we increased the resilience of the business and create new opportunities along the way. Doing this well is essential and will create a competitive advantage. It will influence our access to resources, to partners and markets, to the best talent and to capital. And we're embedding it into every level of the business from strategy and capital allocation to everyday processes and decisions at our sites. We've also introduced a new social value scorecard with 2030 goals, metrics and milestones. This provides clarity to our teams and our ambitions, and allows us to measure progress, transparently report and hold ourselves to account. The scale and longevity of our resources bestow on us a big responsibility to get this right. They also provide significant and numerous pathways for organic growth. At Escondida, we still expect production to average 1.2 million tonnes per annum over the medium term as we mine higher grade areas. Looking further forward, we've accelerated studies to potentially grow production through our concentrator strategy and leaching opportunities. At Olympic Dam, our recently completed maintenance campaign has raised baseline production rates. We're progressing drilling at Oak dam, and we're studying 2-stage smelting as a way to de-constrain operations. One of our most exciting growth pathways comes from our entry into potash. We see huge potential in Jansen, and we are looking to bring forward first production from Stage 1 into 2026 and have started Stage 2 studies. And at Western Australian Iron Ore, our success in debottlenecking our supply chain gives us confidence we can get to over 300 million tonnes per annum over the medium term, and we're studying options to increase this up to 330. The quality of our assets and the organic opportunities embedded within them are incredibly valuable today. However, in a world where high-quality development options to meet growing demand are limited, the value of incumbent producers with existing world-class resources like BHP will only increase further. On top of these organic opportunities, we have many levers to deliver value growth. We are being more agile and commercial and building our capability to add to our options through exploration, innovation and technology, early-stage entry or mergers and acquisitions. We are also growing value through how we bring together our people and culture, systems and processes, technology and innovation. So let me be clear. This is a mutually reinforcing system. It's the way we bring these together, the way they amplify, support and drive each other that unlocks the true potential of each and sets BHP apart. These things take time to embed in the business. We have been laying the foundations across each for the past decade. First and foremost, people and culture. We have an inclusive performance-oriented culture. Our teams are increasingly diverse, which, as I said earlier, we know drives better outcomes. We've reduced frontline supervisor spans of control and are enabling our supervisors to spend more time above 90% in field with their teams. We're bringing more people in-house through operation services and investing in their training as well as developing the next generation of talent through our FutureFit Academy. Our people are engaged and empowered through the BHP operating system, our way of working that creates a culture and capability where we make continuous improvement central to everyone's role. Our common enterprise-wide systems allow us to identify and lock in best practice. And our Centers of Excellence encourage deep technical capability, bringing best practice from other industries and enable fast deployment of improvement ideas around the business. When we combine these with the power of data, of which we have a lot, we accelerate improvements across our value chain from the geoscience required in exploration through to the marketing of our products. Our holistic approach is delivering safer, lower cost, more reliable and more productive operations, accelerating value creation. This year's results demonstrate the resilience and strength of BHP. We face challenges, but we've adapted and overcome them. And in doing so, we've delivered a very strong performance while reshaping our portfolio and redoubling our focus on growth. We've done that because of the combination of qualities that differentiates us from our competitors, both inside and outside of the resources sector: Our continuous improvement culture and leading capability; our portfolio of world-class assets, low cost and with expansion options because of the discipline we apply to capital allocation; and through our efforts to lead on social value. Our ability to consistently deliver strong returns year in and year out is what sets BHP apart. We have done so for many years, and our assets, our portfolio and our growth options position us to continue to deliver for our shareholders and society into the future. As the world moves to decarbonize, as our population continues to grow and as the demand for the commodities that we produce continues to be driven by those persistent trends, BHP is strongly positioned for ongoing success.
