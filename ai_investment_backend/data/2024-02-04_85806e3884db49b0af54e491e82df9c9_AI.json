Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. We finished the fourth quarter strong and the coming year looks stronger. I believe that is generally agreed that the overall market for enterprise AI now appears substantially larger and is growing at a much greater rate than most analysts and expert predicted. We have been working since 2009 to develop product leadership and establish thought leadership in enterprise AI, assisting private and public sector enterprises to apply AI to improve operational processes. C3.ai has been at the vanguard of enterprise AI of the enterprise AI market for over a decade. As the market has developed from its routine IoT to supervised learning, unsupervised learning, NLP, deep learning, reinforcement learning, and now generative AI. In the past 14-years, we have developed and enhanced the C3.ai platform and now offer over 40 enterprise AI applications developed with that platform that allow our customers to rapidly take advantage of AI to improve their business processes. We have been communicating for over a decade that we believe that the market for enterprise AI solutions would be quite large. And now as we enter the summer of 2023 has become a dominant theme in technology discussions, government -- or AI has become a dominant theme in technology discussions, government discussions, media reports, defense and intelligence imperatives and government and business imperatives. I did not believe that it's an overstatement to say that there is no technology leader, no business leader and no government leader, who is not thinking about AI daily. AI chipmakers like NVIDIA are accelerating production to try to keep up with the very real demand that's out there. And all of this is being accelerated by the advent of generative AI. The interest in AI and in applying AI to business and government processes has never been greater. Business inquiries are increasing, the opportunity pipeline is growing, demand is increasing. And C3.ai is well positioned to serve that increasing demand with our tried, tested and proven AI platform, our applications, our global footprint, and our large global ecosystem. The world is, in many ways, now coming to us. The interest in applying AI to business processes is substantially greater than we have ever seen. In the fourth quarter, we increased our customer base, expanded our work with existing clients and saw especially strong growth in our federal business. In the fourth quarter, our total revenue was $72.4 million, our free cash flow was $16.3 million and we ended the quarter with over $812 million in cash and cash equivalents. Importantly, we have a well-defined plan to be sustainably cash positive and non-GAAP profitable by the end of this fiscal year. For fiscal year 2024, I'm sorry, for the fiscal year 2023, okay, total revenue was $266.8 million, an increase of 5.6% over fiscal year \u201922, okay. Subscription revenue was $230.4 million, representing an 11.4% increase over the prior year. Let's talk a little bit about the AI applications market. Now as the enterprise AI market has developed. It appears that the bulk of the demand is increasingly for turnkey enterprise AI applications rather than for development tools. This thesis is supported by an evaluation of our bookings for the past fiscal year that indicates that 83% of our bookings were driven by application sales, 17% of our bookings were driven by the sales of the C3.ai platform. Importantly, we are seeing increasing diversity in the industries we serve. For fiscal year \u201823, an analysis of our bookings includes: oil and gas was 34%; federal, defense, aerospace was 29%, high-tech was 13%; energy and utilities 11%; manufacturing 4%; food processing 2%; chemicals 2%; life sciences 1.5% and other industries made up the remaining 3%. An important leading indicator of our increasing industry diversity is evidenced by the trial and pilot agreements closed in Q4. Federal, defense and aerospace made up almost 37%; manufacturing comprised approximately 16%; and high-tech made up more than 10%. Oil and gas also made up more than 10%. When we look at ag, state, local, chemicals, energy, and financial services each made up approximately 5% of our bookings. As a result of the increased demand for enterprise AI, helped by our transition to consumption based pricing, we are seeing a substantial increase in opportunities and shorter sales cycles. In Q4, we closed 43 agreements, including 19 pilots that were initiated in the quarter. The number of qualified enterprise opportunities targeted for closure within 12-months in our sales pipeline has increased by more than 100% in the past year. During fiscal year \u201823, we closed 126 agreements, up from 83 in the prior year. The average sales cycle for new and expansion deals was 3.7 months down from five months in Q4 of the previous year. An examination of the composition of our pilot account profile suggests there is significant opportunity for growth as these accounts convert to consumption pricing. Of the 19 pilot accounts signed in Q4, seven were accounts greater than $100 billion in revenue, seven were accounts between $10 billion and $100 billion in revenue, four were accounts between $1 billion and $10 billion and one was an account less than $100 million in annual revenue. In fiscal year \u201823, we expanded our application footprint at a number of our customers, including Shell, Koch Industries, the United States Air Force Rapid Sustainment Office, PwC, Ball, ExxonMobil, Con Edison, The Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency, Baker Hughes, the New York Power Authority, Duke Energy, ATB in Canada, Defense Innovation Unit, Roche, Cargill, and Engie. We also established many new relationships during the year, including the Department of Defense Common DoD; AI office; Daly City,; California; DOW; ExxonMobil; Flex; Hexagon; Nucor, Owens-Illinois; Pantaleon; Riverside County, California; Stark County, Ohio; Telus; Department of Defense SOCOM; Department of Defense, TRANSCOM; and ESAB. Many of these also expanded their AI engagements with us in the course of the year. Let's address the C3.ai partner network. The C3.ai partner ecosystem is increasingly effective at opening new doors with our partners, who are able to provide prospects, the assurance of success with -- and the highest quality service. In fiscal year \u201823, we closed 71 agreements with and through our partner network, including Google Cloud, AWS, Microsoft, Baker Hughes, and Booz Allen. C3.ai increased its qualified pipeline with AWS by over 24% in the fourth quarter, with particular focus on state and local government. With Google Cloud, our joint qualified 12-month opportunity pipeline grew from 25 opportunities at the end of fiscal year \u201822 to 140 opportunities at the end of fiscal year \u201823, a 460% increase. And importantly, we closed 10 new oil and gas accounts in the year with our strategic partner Baker Hughes, with accounts including ExxonMobil, ADNOC, ENI, and others. In Q4 we released the C3 Generative AI solution to the market. Our generative AI solution leverages the capabilities of the C3.ai platform and is distinguished from other GPT/LLM solutions in the market in several ways. Number one, it allows enterprises to access all their enterprise data and open source data ERP, CRM, SCADA, text, PDFs, Excel, PowerPoint, sensor data, . Secondly, importantly, it provides traceable deterministic consistent answers. Thirdly, it enforces the corporate information access controls and security protocols that are currently in place. Fourthly., it has no risk of IP or data exfiltration caused by the large language model. And importantly, it is hallucination free. So if the system doesn't know an answer, it doesn't fabricate it, which is clearly unacceptable for any commercial or serious government application. After releasing the product in March, we rapidly closed three generative AI applications in the quarter with large enterprises, including Georgia Pacific, Flint Hills Resources and the U.S. Department of Defense Missile Defense Agency. We expect these applications to be live during this current quarter. We are currently working up quite substantial pipeline as additional C3Candida of AI Opportunities With Large Corporations. The C3 generative AI opportunities with large corporations. The C3.ai generative application is now available -- today available on both the AWS marketplace and the Google Cloud marketplace. It is difficult to estimate size of the addressable market for these generative AI solutions, but it appears to be extraordinarily large. We saw a lot of momentum last year and in fourth quarter with the our U.S. federal business. The U.S. federal sector represented 29% of our bookings in fiscal year \u201923 and it continues to show significant strength. Our predictive maintenance solution, predictive analytics and decision assistant, also known as PANDA, has been in production used for several years at the United States Air Force Rapid Sustainment Office. And last quarter, it was selected as the system of record for all pretty good maintenance for virtually all United States Air Force assets, okay? This important designation expands our opportunity really substantially in the U.S. Air Force and other services. Let's talk about guidance. C3.ai has a consistent and solid track record of meeting or exceeding guidance as we have done in every quarter since we've been public, okay? And we are at this time, we are not inclined to pod on the table regarding guidance. In general, we feel comfortable with the expectations that the sell side analysts have set for the coming year and we are not inclined to change those expectations at this time. For fiscal for Q1 fiscal year \u201824, we see revenue in the range of $70 million to $72.5 million. For the full-year of fiscal year 2024, we expect revenue to be in the range between $295 million and $320 million. As it relates to non-GAAP loss from operations, we expect to fall between $25 million, $30 million in Q1 and $50 million to $70 million for the year. As we begin fiscal year \u201824, C3.ai has never been better positioned. The addressable market is large and expanding, the overall business environment for enterprise AI is strong, and C3.ai is front and center in the minds of CEOs and government leaders. Our balance sheet is strong, and with over $812 million in cash and cash equivalents, we are in a great position to expand market share. As the dynamics of the enterprise AI market are developing so rapidly, we thought it appropriate to host a mid-quarter Investor Day in New York City on June 27th. We will provide, at that time, we will provide C3.ai investors a company update, additional information about our product roadmap, product demonstrations, direct access to the C3.ai executive team, updates on our partner ecosystem, C3.ai, C3 generative AI demonstrations, and additional company developing news, okay. We hope you can attend either in-person or online, and that Investor Day event would be available to view online live, okay, for all investors via webcast. I will now turn this call over to my colleague, Juho Parkkinen, Chief Financial Officer for additional details regarding our financial results. Juho?\nJuho Parkkinen: Thank you, Tom. I will now provide a recap of our financial results, add some color to the drivers of our financials, provide more detail on our first quarter and full-year fiscal 2024 guidance, and I will conclude with some additional color related to the consumption based revenue model we introduced three quarters ago. All figures will be discussed on a non-GAAP basis on this otherwise noted. Overall, the business activity is higher than we have ever seen. Our sales reps are more engaged there are more opportunities they're working on and they're more interest from our prospects. During Q4, our ability to close agreements was more consistent throughout the quarter, compared to prior quarters this fiscal year. We ended the fourth quarter with a total revenue of $72.4 million of which subscription revenue was 78.5%. As we discussed last quarter, we expected professional services would be within our historical range 10% to 20% with our actual professional services coming in at 21.5% of the mix. Gross profit for the fourth quarter was $53.9 million and our gross margin was 74.4%. We generated $27.1 million in positive operating cash flow and $16.3 million in free cash flow for the quarter. As mentioned during the prior updates, we have a short-term pressure on our gross margins, due to a higher mix of pilots, which carry a higher cost of revenue than production deployment. Operating loss of $23.5 million was improved due to more rigorous expense management. As a reminder though, the fourth quarter is when we host our C3.ai transform customer events, as such, our marketing expenses ramped up to support the successful execution of that event. Operating loss margin was 32.5% in Q4, where the sequential increase was driven by our annual conference. With the full year fiscal 2023 our revenue was $266.8 million, an increase of 5.6% from fiscal 2022. Non-GAAP loss from operations was $68.1 million and free cash flow was negative $187 million. Our gross margin for the year was 77%, our subscription revenue was 86% of total revenue, compared to 82% in fiscal \u201822. We ended fiscal \u201823 with $812.4 million in cash and investments. At the end of Q4, our accounts receivable including unbilled receivables was $134.6 million. Unbilled receivables at quarter end was $77.6 million, inclusive of $70.7 million related to Baker Hughes. During the quarter, we collected from Baker Hughes, nearly $35 million. The general health of our accounts receivable is excellent, 76% of our receivables were current or less than 30-days past due. For the entirety of our FY \u201823, our bad debt expense was approximately $300,000. Now turning to RPO and bookings. As consumption based go-to-market model continues to pick up, RPO is less important indicator of future performance. We reported GAAP RPO of $381.4 million, down 20% from last year, which is expected as a result of the transition to consumption based pricing. Trade GAAP RPO of $186.3 million, is up 9.8% from last year end and up 5.7% on a sequential basis. We continue to see positive trends in pilot bookings diversity as we have sold pilots to a broad range of nine different industries during the quarter. Regarding our outlook for fiscal \u201824, regarding Q1 revenue to range between $70 million to $72.5 million. For the full-year 2024, we expect revenue to range between $295 million and $320 million. As it relates to the full-year, we finished the third quarter of our transition under the consumption pricing model, as a  model, we expect flatness and somewhat of a decline in revenue during the transition with an acceleration as consumption starts to have meaningful portion of our in-quarter revenue. As such, we expect the second-half of FY \u201924 to have higher growth rates on a sequential basis than the first-half. We expect our non-GAAP loss from operations to range between $25 million and $30 million for Q1 and for full fiscal \u201824 we expect non-GAAP loss from operations between $50 million and $75 million. As a reminder, we expect to be non-GAAP profitable for Q4 \u201924 and beyond, and as it relates to full fiscal \u201824, we are guiding to a range in operating loss due to the potential investments we made through -- for C3 generative AI applications. We expect our cash and investments to be at its lowest at around $700 million during fiscal \u201824. Turning to customer metrics. Historically, we have provided a quarterly customer count estimate as a proxy for the adoption of our products and solutions. However, due to the complexity of our contractual and pricing structures and the involvement of resellers, we believe comparing customer counts from quarter-to-quarter based on our current methodology, we -- apologies. Customer comps from quarter-to-quarter based on our current methodology does not fully convey the acceptance and adoption of our products and solutions. To help address this, we retained an external Big Four consulting firm to update our current customer count methodology consistent with best practices to be consistent, systematic and auditable. As a result of that review, and adoption of those recommendations, we believe a metric that demonstrates contracted use cases that our customers are using our solutions to solve would provide a more meaningful understanding of the product reduction. This is defined as customer engagement. The customer engagement increased from 247 to 287, comparing Q3 \u201823 to Q4 \u201823. Our traditional customer count metric went from 236 to 244 for the same period. There will be additional detail included in the supplement, which is available on our website. We are on track with our planned for profitability for Q4 \u201824 and expect to have cash positive this quarter starting Q4 \u201824 on a consistent go forward basis. The entire executive team is managing the business to have detailed budgets on our plan for profitability. We are expecting to invest aggressively to generative AI initiatives during the first-half of the year, which is reflected in the operating income guidance. As it relates to the model assumptions that we provided three quarters ago for our consumption based pricing, our preliminary analysis of the actual results suggest we are on that model. Overall, we're very excited about the business momentum as we start FY \u201824. As a go forward KPI for the investing community to assess our performance, we believe good KPIs to focus are the number of pilots started during the quarter the conversion of those pilots to production and finally, the actual vCPU consumption fees generated. With that, I would like to open this up for questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you.  Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Kingsley Crane of Canaccord. Your line is open.\nKingsley Crane: Hi, thanks for taking the question. So Tom, you said that sales cycles were down to 3.7 months from five months last year. Why do you think that is? Is this entirely due to the consumption model? How much of this is due to general excitement around the potential in the space? And even potentially increased sales force productivity?\nTom Siebel: No, I think -- thanks Kingsley. I think it's all of that. I mean, clearly, AI is on everybody's mind, the consumption based pricing model that we have makes it much easier to adopt our technology. In the old days, one and two years ago to do business with us was $5 million, $10 million, $20 million, $50 million to open the door. And now the transaction is pretty much, you know, we'll bring the application live in six months or $0.5 million. If you like it, keep it and pay $0.55 per CPU hours to be CPU hour, so we're pretty easy to do business with. And so we're seeing the number of transactions increase dramatically as we'd expect. The ease of contracting with us. As you know, we have largely reconstituted the sales organization in the last 1.5 years to a sales team that is candidly much more productive and effective than our other sales organizations. So I think all of those are contributing to increased pipeline, increased business, increased business activity by which we're quite optimistic.\nKingsley Crane: Thanks, Tom. That's really helpful. And then one for Juho. When I think about the timing of the transition. So -- if it is the case that the vast majority of existing customers are not necessarily migrating to the consumption model, how should we think about the contribution of consumption over time and particularly in the back half? Because I think that you said revenue could accelerate as consumption increases in mix?\nJuho Parkkinen: Yes, Kingsley, thanks for that question. So that's exactly as we sign and initiate more pilots within the quarter. The pilots are generally two quarters long, and then you start to see the consumption revenue kick in. As we finished the quarter with 19 pilots last quarter, we had a good increase in pilots with 17 pilots as well. You can start seeing those layer on to the revenue by Q3 and Q4 of this fiscal year. Now to your point about renewals, we do expect our existing customers with the large enterprise agreements to continue to remain on those types of agreement structures, but you will see the RPO trickle down as these contracts enter into renewal phase, and then we would expect to see a pickup as they renew.\nKingsley Crane: Okay. Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you.  Our next question comes from the line of Pat Walravens of JMP Securities. Your line is open.\nPat Walravens: Oh, great. Thank you. Tom, can you talk some more about the opportunity with National Security and the Department of Defense? And then also, you said something I thought was interesting about a version of generative AI that doesn't hallucinate, if you could maybe comment a little more on what hallucinating is? And how you prevent it from doing that, I think that would be really interesting? Thank you.\nTom Siebel: DoD, well, Pat, you asked kind of many times about the -- we have two basically authorities to operate contract vehicles once were $100 million and once were $1.5 billion in DoD that are associated. It could be applicable to what we're doing at RSO, that was the rapid sustainment office and the predictive maintenance application that we're doing for the United States Air Force for F-15, F-16, F-18, F-35, KC-135, et cetera. And what we made a proposal to the Secretary of the Air Force to take that into full production for all the aircraft in the Air Force, which is 5,000. I think the proposal would have increased aircraft availability for the Air Force by 25%. And I think decrease their cost of maintenance and readiness by about $6 billion. So he considered that as did his Chief of Staff, General Brown, and they went off on their own for a few months, while you were asking the questions, and we didn't have the answers and these guys go into their start chamber the way they do. What they came out with was not -- was a selection of C3 as the standard -- as the system of record, not only for aircraft in the United States Air Force, but for all AI-based all predicted maintenance, okay, in the United States Air Force for all assets. So this is genuinely a big deal, okay. Now we have the opportunity to make this a line item in the budget. So this is -- it's hard to over describe the impact of the - overestimate the impact of this. And then not only do we have it in Air Force, we can talk now to other services like the Army and the Navy and the Marines and the National Guard, what have you. So this is a big one. The second one has to do with generative AI. So one of the problems with generative AI is the -- is you're limited to the number of data sources that you can use with these large language models typically is text, HTML and sometimes code. And the large language model will interact directly with the data. But one of the problems is you get, kind of, random answers. Every time you ask the question, you get a different answer. If two people ask the same question they get a different answer. And the -- there's no traceability. It doesn't tell you where the answer came from, okay, and finally, if it doesn't know the answer, it makes one up. This is what they call hallucination. So it doesn't know so it just kind of wings it, makes up an answer. So we've leveraged -- we're using the entire C3 platform. And the way that we do that is we incorporate -- as you, I think, all know, we're very good at aggregating enterprise data, extraprise data, code, images, text, sensor data, what have you, into a unified federated image. When we do that, those data are read by a deep learning model and they happen to be stored in a vector database that we have a kind of a firewall between that and the large language model. Now our customer uses any language model they want, be it ChatGPT, be it Palm, be it Bard, be it FLAN T5, whatever it may -- whatever comes along next. Now, but we built a firewall between the large language model and the data. So it will -- every time -- I mean what's really -- every time you ask the question, it will give you the same answer. Okay, if two people ask the same question and they have the authority, they will both get the same answer every time. Associated with the answer, it provides you traceability to see if they click on it, you can see exactly where the data can come from, okay? And very importantly, there's no risk of LLM caused data exfiltration, see Samsung for details where they find out that all of their proprietary information is not published on the Internet, okay? And finally, there's no risk of LLM caused hallucination. If it doesn't know the answer, it tells I don't know the answer rather than making one up. So for these, you think would be kind of table stakes, and they are table stakes for any large commercial or government installation, and this is something that really distinguishes the C3 generative AI offering. And one of the reasons that we're seeing very high levels of interest.\nPat Walravens: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you.  Our next question comes from the line of Sanjit Singh of Morgan Stanley. Again, our next question comes from the line of Sanjit Singh of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nSanjit Singh: Appreciate you guys squeezing me in for the question. Tom, earlier this week, you guys announced had a press release about the C3 generative AI suite being available in the Amazon Marketplace. And it got me thinking about what the sales motion going forward is going to look like? As you sort of mentioned, generative AI is permeating the boardroom, the C-suite in a pretty substantial way. And when we look at sort of converting this interest into deals and ultimately revenue. How much of this is going to be like flywheel kind of self-service consumption-based marketplace type deals versus you working with partners to get more consultants as and helping these large enterprise customers, sort of, navigate the world of generative AI actually deliver value?\nTom Siebel: Great question, Sanjit. So our first three engagements that are evolved in now will be -- our organization is the order of $100 billion or greater in revenue, okay, and have -- we'll bring the application live in 12 weeks. We're not doing it -- and we have like three people on the project, so it's pretty straightforward. Now the issue of going from, say, six customers to 60 customers to 100 customers, it's pretty straightforward. We know how to do that, okay? The real key is, okay, in terms of blowing the doors off this thing, can we go from six customers to 60 customers to 6,000. So for 6,000, now we have to leverage these channels like the AWS marketplace where the product is available today, the Google marketplace where they're available today. But in terms of usability, it needs to be with the Apple iPhone. You open the box, you take the cellphone off, you turn it on and it works. And so now we're -- the next generation -- the next -- the really serious development work that we're doing now on that product, kind of, relates to really product design, okay, and making it like an Apple product, you open it up, you turn it on and it works. And so that's the challenge that's before us. I think we're up to it, okay? And if we're able to hit that note, hold on to your stock.\nSanjit Singh: I appreciate the color, Tom. And then maybe one follow-up. Maybe this is for Juho and Tom as well. And it sort of relates to the guidance for the full-year. I'm trying to contextualize like what's really driving the guidance for next year? Because we're coming off a year, fiscal year '21, I think you guys grew north of 30%, 33%, 34%. And this past year, you guys grew sort of mid-single-digits. The initial guidance calls for growth sort of mid-teens at the midpoint sort of 20% at the high-end. And I want to understand, like is the acceleration you're seeing a function that you're coming off a tougher year where you had a spending environment is more difficult, sales reorg, those types of things versus generative AI really coming online in fiscal year \u201824. And so is there any way you can, sort of, attribute those two things between sort of coming off of a tougher year versus the demand that you're seeing in pilots out in the field?\nTom Siebel: Let me address the premise, okay? Before we all bring our hands about tougher year, tougher year, tougher year. I think we got that in 4 times in the call for all the audience. Okay, let's remember, okay? When we are now the transition to consumption-based pricing, okay, we made it very clear that this was going to have a short and mid-term, okay, negative effect on revenue growth. It's actually a mess. Anybody who knows how to use a spreadsheet can figure this out. If we're closing $0.5 million deals instead of $10 million, $20 million, $30 million, $40 million, $50 million deals, the short-term impact on revenue is to dampen revenue growth. So I'm not certain that's so tough. Okay, that is basically we're actually getting exactly the plan that we set. So this thing is exactly on track. Now when you run this three year a little extra spreadsheet model and you hit the carriage return, okay, and you run it out a few years -- a few quarters out there, you can do the math and you know what happens. But I'm not -- so I think we're exactly on plan with what we did. We made the investment. I think it was a great decision. It was a good investment. And now in fiscal year \u201824 and \u201825, we're going to yield the returns from that investment.\nSanjit Singh: Great. Appreciate for that.\nOperator: Thank you.  Our next question comes from the line of John Katsingris of Wedbush. Your line is open.\nJohn Katsingris: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. John on for Dan Ives, so given the increased diversity seen, I guess, across industries served, how have you seen these use cases develop? And how do you see them playing out in the future? Thank you.\nTom Siebel: Great question, John. Right now, I mean, in terms of applying AI to enterprise we're in first-half of the first inning and the first guys that, okay. So this is an embryotic market. I mean, where we're seeing the biggest uptake media. First, it was in the SmartGrid, okay. Why the SmartGrid because they had invested $2 trillion, okay, upgraded infrastructure globally to make all the devices in the SmartGrid, remotely machine addressable, a huge IoT constellation. So that's where we saw it first. The next large -- what we're seeing in the past year, the largest market is in AI reliability, basically predictive maintenance. So they can move the military, they called readiness, okay, or in the Par average sector, they call reliability. So AI-based predictive maintenance is the largest segment today. How will this evolve? I mean, it's clear we will be applying AI to all business processes, production optimization, demand forecasting, supply chain risk okay, stochastic optimization, the supply chain CRM, either. I think there is no aspect of business operations that will not be or -- and medicine, okay, and research and the science and literature, entertainment that will not be accelerated by the use of AI. So we're just going to have to -- we're along for the ride and we're going to see where this goes in the next few years and stay on the balls of our feet as it develops, but it is a rocket ship.\nJohn Katsingris: Thank you, Tom.\nOperator: Thank you.  Our next question comes from the line of Mike Cikos of Needham & Company. Your line is open.\nMike Cikos: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions here. Maybe the first would be going to Juho. So I know that you guys have cited the 43 deals you closed this quarter, 19 of those are pilots. Can you further refine that for us? And maybe it's just the classifications or names we're using for this. But like how many of those pilots are purely consumption-based versus maybe pilots that are still coming in under the old pricing model?\nJuho Parkkinen: Mike, these are all -- these would all follow the new consumption-based approach. These are not under the old model at all.\nMike Cikos: Okay. And so I guess the follow-up that I have on that is with the 19 deals that are consumption based, and I know that you guys have pulled -- I'm sorry, 19 pilots that you guys closed or initiated that are a consumption base this quarter and the other pilots that we've decided in previous quarters. Do we have a feel for how many of these pilots have now converted to production? And do we have a gauge for what the vCPU is for those consumption deals once they move into production?\nJuho Parkkinen: That's a great question. So Michael, on the first quarter, we announced this would have been Q2, which obviously, you take six months from that, we get towards the end of Q4. So we are very early in that in the conversions. We are standing by with the model assumptions, i.e., whatever we provided three quarters ago where it is, each pilot is expected at 70% likelihood to convert into a follow-on consumption deal. But I would say that the first quarter before consumptions, we really will start seeing more of that this quarter since it was late in Q2 as we entered into those original pilot arrangements.\nMike Cikos: Understood. Understood on that. Thanks for that. And then just one quick follow-up, if I could. But I wanted to add just on the professional services revenue. I know it's you just a tick higher versus the typical 10% to 20% range we've been talking about. And I just wanted to see, is 10% to 20% still the appropriate range we should be thinking through? Or is there maybe more handholding for these pilots as you guys engage in them? Or is it maybe handholding of potentially federal sector customers? Like how do we think about the higher pro-serve revenue generation in Q4 versus what you guys are thinking about over the next year?\nJuho Parkkinen: I think on a go-forward basis, we expect to be in the 10% to 20% range. There's always going to be these types of projects that our customers want, and it's difficult to forecast a specific in a go-forward revenue, but we believe 10% to 20% is appropriate on a go-forward basis.\nMike Cikos: Thank you for that. I\u2019ll turn it back to my colleagues. Appreciate the time.\nOperator: Thank you.  Our next question comes from the line of Brad Sills of Bank of America. Your line is open.\nBrad Sills: Hey, great. Thank you. This is Adam Bergere on for Brad Sills. So you're pretty well positioned in the current market, just given AI use cases are coming into focus. So kind of curious if it's changed your cadence for R&D investments at all?\nTom Siebel: Well, this is Tom. I mean, clearly, the investments we've made in the last 14 years are paying off, okay, in that we have over 40 applications and people want applications. And I think we're the only company in the world, but that's for the applications. I think that -- I think the only recent change that we've made is we're a little bit shocked by the response that we had to C3 generative AI. I mean that is -- we're a little bit overwhelmed by that. But that's a big opportunity. And so now we just came off a plane mean and we decided to really invest in that product category in a big way, because it's just difficult to estimate that market, but it's extraordinarily large.\nAdam Bergere: Yes. Fair enough. And then for kind of the generative AI use cases and solutions thus far, I guess, the first is your first take on it. But do you see any outsized uptake or expect any outsized uptick within certain verticals over others in your view? Thank you.\nTom Siebel: It's a good question. It kind of seems like everybody is interested in this. They want -- at the level of the CEO or the person who operates manufacturing and the person to operate sales they want basically a Google-like interface where they got to a web browser like interface where they can ask any question about their business, okay? Where the problems in our supply chain? If I'm the Chair of the Joint Chiefs, what am I ready to less levels, they have 35-ish quadrants and okay, in Central Europe. I mean that's what we call Google for DoD, but their open initiatives can provide the Secretary of Defense or the Chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff answers to that question in seconds. Right now, it actually takes a week for him or most people to get those answers. So it's I don't know any industry that will not be taking use of this technology. It's really quite amazing.\nAdam Bergere: Alright. I appreciate the perspective, Tom. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you.  Our next question comes from the line of Mike Cikos of Needham Company. Your line is open.\nMike Cikos: Hey, guys. Thanks for getting back and I did just have one quick follow-up. And maybe building on the question that Sanjit had asked earlier, but taking a different look rather than looking at the revenue, let's talk profitability for a second. But obviously, you guys are issuing guidance now, which is below street and below what you guys had initially flagged if we go back a quarter ago, maybe for Juho. Can you help us think about the additional levers you have to pull on to ensure that C3 is achieving its target of exit fiscal \u201824 with non-GAAP profitability?\nTom Siebel: Before we answer it, Mike. I do want to poke at the premise a little bit, okay. I think our guidance is pretty much in line with what the Street expectations are once you take out like one outlier or two outliers. So our current guidance is in line with what the Street has. I'm pretty confident in that. Now Juho the other question related to how are you sure you're going to get to profitability?\nJuho Parkkinen: Right. So Mike, one of the things that I had on the prepared remarks was our planned investments into generative which combine that and vendor expenses, I think we can control spending towards the end of the year, if for whatever reason, the expected revenue would not occur from those. But we're pretty bullish about the generative AI opportunity.\nMike Cikos: Got it. Thank you, very much.\nTom Siebel: Let me. Said, we don't need the generative AI for purity to be generally, generative AI could be zero, okay? And we're still going to run a cash profitable business in Q4. Well, you have a very, very detailed plan that's been  to all the members and the management team. They all have big budgets. They know that's going to operate and you can expect it to be in cash positive profitable business non-GAAP pro-business in Q4, hard stuff.\nMike Cikos: That\u2019s right.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment, please.\nTom Siebel: One more question?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Noah Harman of JMP Securities. Your line is open.\nNoah Harman: It is great to see the average sales cycles for agreements ticked down, I think, by about one, three months year-over-year. What's really driving that? And where do you think a sustainable sales cycle basically concludes that maybe thinking about the rest of this year?\nTom Siebel: Well, I think the consumption-based pricing model is driving it where it's pretty easy to do. We're not going to have a large-scale enterprise AI application live in production in six months for $0.5 million. I mean that's nothing guys in terms of what it costs to bring in an Accenture or an IBM or somebody to try to bring one of these things, that's going to be scores of millions of dollars in the years. So it's a pretty easy sale. It's a shorter sales cycle. And so I'm not sure where it ends up, but as we move more into more of our products, onto the AWS marketplace, the Google marketplace and other leverage channels like this. So we'd expect to see it get shorter.\nNoah Harman: Great. Thank you.\nTom Siebel: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time I\u2019m going to turn the call back over to Mr. Siebel for any closing remarks.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference.

Welcome to the C3 AI Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2023 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Reuben Gallegos. Please go ahead.\nReuben Gallegos: Thank you, and good afternoon, and welcome to C3AI's Earnings Call for the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, which ended January 31, 2023. My name is Reuben Gallegos, and I am the Vice President of Investor Relations. With me on the call today is Tom Siebel, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Ed Abbo, our Chief Technology Officer; Juho Parkkinen, our Chief Financial Officer. After the market closed today, we issued a press release with details regarding our third quarter results as well as the supplemental to our results, both of which can be accessed through our Investor Relations section of our website at ir.c3.ai. This call is being webcast, and a replay will be available on our IR website following the conclusion of this call. During today's call, we will make statements related to our business that may be considered forward looking under federal securities laws. These statements reflect our views only as of today and should not be considered representative of our views as of any subsequent date. We disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements or outlook. These statements are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. Before a further discussion of the material risks and other important factors that could affect our actual results, please refer to our filings with the SEC. Today, all figures will be discussed on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. And also after the course of today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP is included in our press release. Finally, at times in our prepared remarks in response to your questions, we may discuss the metrics that are incremental to our usual presentation to get greater insight into the dynamics of our business or our quarterly results. Please be advised that we may or may not continue to provide this additional detail in the future. And with that, let me turn the call over to Tom.\nTom Siebel: Okay. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. You might recall that two quarters ago, I spoke of economic headwinds, lengthening sales cycles, as our customers and prospects anticipated recession. In July and August of 2022, we saw a significant negative change in the business environment with the lengthening of decision cycles, and I caution that the market downturn could be significant. Now as we enter into our fourth quarter, we are seeing tailwinds on from improved business optimism and increased interest in applying C3 AI solutions to address an increasing range of applications across a broadening set of industries. This is a dramatic change from what we experienced in mid-2022. There is a genuine optimism in the marketplace for our solutions. And the overall business sentiment appears to be substantially improving. In the course of the quarter, we validated our transition to a consumption-based pricing model. We expanded our partner ecosystem. We expanded our business pipeline. We delivered industry-leading product innovation in enterprise AI. And importantly, we remain on track to become cash positive and non-GAAP profitable by the end of fiscal year '24. Looking at third quarter results, we delivered a strong quarter. Our total revenue was $66.7 million, which exceeded our guidance. Current RPO increased to $176.3 million, and we have 236 customers. We ended the quarter with almost $790 million in cash. And as we enter Q4, we believe C3 AI is well positioned to continue to invest in growth through enterprise AI innovation and sales expansion while sustaining our path to profitability. Importantly, we have validated the consumption-based pricing model. The response to our consumption-based pricing model from partners and prospects has been uniformly enthusiastic Believe it or not, we currently have more than 290 qualified pilot opportunities in our pipeline, exceeding our expectations. Our pilot to production conversion rate is on track. The consumption pricing revenue conversion model that we provided last quarter, and Juho will review that with you in a few minutes, appears to be realistic, suggesting substantially increasing revenue growth rates in fiscal year '24 and beyond. We made significant progress with our partner ecosystem in the third quarter. We established, reestablished and substantially expanded our go-to-market partnerships. With Google Cloud, we closed eight new customer deals and expanded our joint pipeline. Our combined teams are currently pursuing 291 enterprise opportunities for our joint solutions, over 100 of which we are currently engaged in licensing discussions. Thomas Kurian, the CEO of Google Cloud and I held a joint meeting with a number of clients, prospects and partners in the U.S. federal region. We've made substantial progress to ensure that all C3 products perform optimally in the Google cloud environment. Finally, we expanded our partnership agreement with Google, so that our customers can purchase any C3 AI software solution on the Google cloud marketplace. We also renewed and expanded our go-to-market partnership with AWS in the quarter. AWS funded C3 AI to enhance its C3 AI law enforcement application to ensure that it's optimized for AWS, integrating Amazon Open Search and AWS machine learning services to enhance the speed and quality of analysis for state and local agencies using the application on AWS. C3 and AWS are currently pursuing 75 new opportunities, of which 41 appear highly qualified, and we closed six agreements in the quarter. With Azure, we collaborated to close the deal with a super major U.S. energy company and a European technology company serving the mining and construction sectors. We've cooperated to deliver a highly successful pilot engagement to a large U.S. defense agency that shows potential for very large expansion. In the quarter, we established a highly strategic relationship with Booz Allen focused on providing solutions to the government defense intelligent sectors. When we are jointly going to market with Booz Allen to bring the C3 AI platform and our suite of prebuilt C3 AI solutions to solve their requirements, together, the companies have cross-trained our employees on our respective services, and we already closed our first engagement with the Chief Digital Artificial Intelligence Office CDAO. With Accenture, we renewed our partnership to help customers drive product innovation, design and development and provide strategic support and systems integration at scale. Together, the companies have trained Accenture employees on the C3 AI platform and have already collaborated to close two pilot deals in the consumer packaged goods and oil and gas sectors. We are actively engaged with a large oil and gas services company and have generated several new opportunities with target accounts. With EY, we are teaming to address the needs of the health care industry in the U.K. With Peraton, a Washington, D.C. Beltway systems integrator, we entered into a partnering agreement to address the modernization of the Veterans Administration. With Baker Hughes, we substantially expanded our strategic partnership in the third quarter. The terms of this expansion resulted in an incremental C3 booking of $32.5 million and the frequency of payments from Baker Hughes was accelerated over the term of the agreement. C3 AI agreed to provide additional products and services to Baker Hughes and provided Baker Hughes additional flexibility in the manner in which they sell AI products and services. The expanded agreement also enables Baker Hughes to extend the term of the agreement at its option beyond its current six-year term. We believe the partnership with Baker Hughes has substantially enhanced our credibility in oil and gas and chemicals markets. As a result of our partnership with Baker Hughes, combining both joint selling through the partnership and the sales that we have closed independently of Baker Hughes, C3 AI has closed to date, 87 contracts in the oil and gas and chemical sector, including LyondellBasell, Shell, ExxonMobil, Petronas, ENI, Aramco, Qatar Gas, ADNOC, Yokagawa, Baker Hughes, Braskem, Frontier Resources and others. All of these in aggregate have resulted in our closing over $650 million in bookings, and we have recognized in excess of $350 million in revenue through the third quarter of fiscal year '23. Let me talk for a minute about our ESG solutions. We've made significant progress with our ESG application, which is part of our sustainability suite, which includes C3 AI energy management, our most mature application that was first introduced to market in the first quarter of 2010. This product used to measure, manage and mitigate the energy and greenhouse gas footprint at over 6 million residences and businesses today. In September of 2022, we announced the availability of C3 AI ESG developed as a significant enhancement to the C3 AI energy management suite. C3 AI ESG provides a single source of truth for all matters of materiality related to ESG, aggregated and synthesis size the many ERP, supply chain, procurement, Cadence, CRM, HR and other enterprise systems installed in an enterprise, all track longitudinally at the asset division and corporate levels. This enables organizations to publish their ESG compliance reports consistent with a multiplicity of conflicting ESG reporting standards, including SASB, GRI, TCFD and CDP. Most importantly, C3 AI ESG provides rich predictive analytics using AI to allow managers to track their gaps to plan for ESG materiality in out years, be it CO2, H2O, methane, workplace injuries, whatever. And it recommends mitigation measures to close the gaps so the Company can be assured of meeting its ESG objectives in 2030, 2040, 2050, et cetera. According to Verdantix, ESG represents a $16 billion addressable market in 2027, and our product is being enthusiastically received. Our initial ESG customers are EY, Shell and Baker Hughes. Now I'd like to talk a little bit about our intellectual property portfolio. C3 AI continues to make significant investments in technology innovation. We have been awarded 26 patents to date and have an additional 90 patents pending. One of our most important inventions is the model-driven architecture for enterprise AI applications, the core architecture of the platform. We have issued several patents for this architecture, including systems, methods and devices for an enterprise AI application development platform. This platform provides all the software service is necessary and sufficient for the rapid development, deployment and operation of enterprise AI applications. Importantly, it also serves as an orchestration system, allowing us to immediately embed and exploit the utility of ongoing innovations in the open source and proprietary world. Examples include new techniques in machine learning, virtualization, encryption, commercial products like Databricks, Snowflake, Vertex AI, Amazon SageMaker; Azure ML, TensorFlow, Jupyter, Python, et cetera, all of which are immediately compatible and interoperable with the C3 AI platform and all of which are commonly used by many of our customers. The recent explosion of innovation and availability of large language models and generative free trading transformers are also immediately compatible with the C3 AI platform, enabling us to increase the utility of our platform and our applications. We believe the importance of the ongoing developments in generative AI is difficult to overestimate. Now, there's been a lot of recent news about C3 generative AI. Let me address that for a moment. By combining the utility of the C3 AI platform, predictive analysis enterprise search, natural language processing, generative pre-trained transformers and reinforcement learning, we have developed a new and novel technique to fundamentally improve the human computer interface for enterprise applications. This is kind of a non-obvious use of generative AI. This is not about chat, okay? This is about enterprise search. And we believe that this invention represents a breakthrough development that will dramatically facilitate the ease of use and explainability of enterprise AI applications. In addition to providing users immediate, highly controlled access to potentially the entire body of data and information systems within an enterprise, be it Dow Chemical, the United States Air Force, Shell, whatever it may be. In the news release that we put out, we have a link to that application. So you can actually see what it is, how it works and how it put it together. And if you're interested, I encourage you to take a look at it. It is really neat. Okay. We expect the C3 AI generative search capability to be incorporated into the C3 platform and applications and generally available to our customer base this spring. It is currently being deployed as a core capability in the C3 AI platform, and we are doing early deployments at Koch Industries and Baker Hughes. To protect this intellectual property, we have several patents pending in multiple jurisdictions around the world. And I encourage you to go find the link on our website and take a look at it because it is really something. Okay. Let's talk about guidance. Turning to guidance for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2021, I will remind everybody on the call that this is the eighth consecutive quarter as a public company, in which the third quarter is the eighth consecutive quarter in which we have exceeded our revenue guidance, okay? We expect revenue for Q4 to be between -- Q4 2023 between $70 million and $72 million. And for the full year fiscal year '23, we expect revenue to range between $264 million and $266 million. Bottom line, Q3 was solid. We have validated the consumption-based pricing model, okay? The addressable market is huge. Business is strong. Customers are happy. Our workforce is highly productive and the future is bright. And now, I will turn this over to my colleague, Juho Parkkinen, for additional details regarding our financial results. Juho?\nJuho Parkkinen: Thank you, Tom. I will now provide a recap of our financial results, add some color to the drivers of our financials discuss our expected path to non-GAAP operating profitability by the end of fiscal '24, and I will conclude with some additional color related to the consumption-based revenue model we introduced two quarters ago. All figures will be discussed on a non-GAAP basis, unless otherwise noted. As Tom mentioned, we ended the quarter with revenue of $66.7 million, of which subscription revenue was 85.6%. Gross profit was $51 million and gross margin was 76%. As I mentioned during the last quarter's update, we have a short-term pressure on our gross margins due to a higher mix of climate which carry a higher cost of revenue during the pilot phase of our customer life cycle. Operating loss of a negative $15 million improved year-over-year and was significantly above our guidance due to improved vendor expense management and timing of payment. Operating loss margin was flat at negative 23% as compared to the same period in the prior year. However, on a sequential basis, our operating loss margin improved. Our customer count increased 8% to 236, and we closed 27 deals during the quarter, 17 of which were pilot deals under the consumption model. Now turning to RPO and bookings. We reported GAAP RPO of $403 million, which is down 14% from last year. This was expected as we transition to consumption-based deals. Trade GAAP RPO of $176.3 million is up 3% from last year and 7% on a sequential basis. We continue to see positive trends in pilot bookings diversity as we have increased to nine industry segments in Q3 compared to six in Q2. Regarding our cash flow, free cash flow improved to an outflow of $71.7 million compared to $77 million in the prior quarter. Breaking this down, $19.4 million was related to the build-out of our new headquarters, which we moved into in February. Normalizing for this payment, our adjusted free cash flow improved to an outflow of $52.3 million compared to $54.3 million last quarter. We continue to expand our headquarters and we'll have additional cash outflow in the following quarters as we take over additional spend. During the quarter, we expanded the Baker Hughes partnership. As Tom mentioned, the changes are designed to provide increased flexibility to Baker Hughes to provide the BH C3 AI solutions to the market. This resulted in the elimination of the variable consideration, which increased the transaction price by $32.5 million. Regarding outlook. As Tom highlighted, we are able to narrow our range as we have more visibility as we enter Q4. As such, we're guiding Q4 to $70 million to $72 million. And for the year, we're tightening the guide from $264 million to $266 million. For Q4 '23, we expect our non-GAAP loss from operations in the range of $24 million to $28 million, that is negative. And for the full year, we expect the non-GAAP loss from operations of negative $69 million to negative $73 million. In accordance with our plan, we do expect gross margin percentage to be negatively impacted by the number of pilots active in the fourth quarter. Please recall that during the two quarter pilot period, customer will have unlimited run time and premium support resources sufficient to be successful with their target engagement and gain value from the C3 AI software. During this pilot period, our subscription cost of revenue will be elevated until the conversion to consumption-based pricing occurs. Over time, we expect gross margin percentage to revert to historical ranges as higher percentage of customers on a pilot move to consumption revenue. Our operating margin guidance reflects the fact that we have C3 transform the world's premier enterprise AR conference and our major customer events happening next week, and we will have related marketing expenses for this quarter's costs. In addition, as we have discussed previously, we're increasing our sales head count to meet the demand we are seeing for our consumption-based pricing sales and expect to see increased expense in the fourth quarter as a result. It is important to note that we expect that our cash balance will continue to decline into next fiscal year as we complete the build-out of our headquarters. We expect our cash and investments to be at its lowest at around $700 million during fiscal '24. Broadly speaking, as a result of the introduction to consumption-based pricing, we expect RPO to trend down over the coming quarters with some exceptions relating to renewals and existing customer expansions. Also, before I end, I'd like to take the opportunity to shed some light into the details in our financial plan and the progress we're making with our consumption-based pricing. As Tom mentioned in his comments, we are on track with our plan to achieve non-GAAP profitability by the end of fiscal year '24. On a quarterly basis, we assess the business landscape and adjust our operating plan based on what we're experiencing in the market. During Q1, as Tom mentioned in his remarks, back then, we experienced headwinds and to caution that the market downturn could be significant. We and the management team adjusted our operating plan and build out a careful trap to become operating profitable by the end of FY '24. We are on that plan. In order to make sure that we monitor that plan, we have prepared detailed department of budgets. We track variances, we hold managers responsible. And if there are variances, we correct them immediately. In our investor supplement, we have shared our current projected path to operating profit on a relative expense basis. Obviously, as I mentioned, we review our plan each quarter, but I wanted to share the detailed path with you guys at this time. As it relates to the model assumptions that we provided two quarters ago for our consumption-based pricing business, our preliminary analysis of the actual results suggest that we are at or better than that model. Therefore, to summarize, quarter results were above expectations and guidance clear and well-understood plan for our path to profitability is in action and our consumption-based model assumptions are on track. With these remarks, I would like to open this call up for questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Mike Cikos with Needham & Company. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nMike Cikos: I wanted to start off with some of the comments that you guys had around the customer dynamics because I just want to make sure I'm clear on how we're looking at things. If I'm counting, I think the customer count was actually flat quarter-to-quarter as far as total customer count. But I know -- I think Juho in your prepared remarks have discussed C3 had closed 27 deals 17 of those were pilots under the consumption model. Can you just help us think through like how are you guys prioritizing? Who goes into that category, when do they become would you term a customer?\nJuho Parkkinen: Of course, yes. Thanks, Mike, for the question. So if you take a look at our quarterly filings, we've provided kind of a detailed definition of what our customer is, but I'll provide it here as well. So within a customer entity, which you can think about the ultimate parent of, let's say, coke industries there could be several subsidiaries, groups, departments, various budget owners or various groups that use either incrementally or tool or use it in different use cases. That -- all of those individual groups we would characterize as a customer.\nMike Cikos: I guess what I'm getting at is if you closed 27 deals and 17 were pilots, right? If I think about the 27 deals that you guys closed, the assumption is then that they were all with existing customers. Is that fair? Or I guess there's movement under the hood in that customer cap that you're providing Again, I'm just looking at the customer count being flat quarter-to-quarter.\nJuho Parkkinen: Yes, totally understand. So let me clarify. So, we are still broadly speaking, in our transition phase to the pure pilot model. And if you recall in some of our prior conversations, some of the old trial arrangements, which are a customer in the period when their trials upon the ending of the trial period. We engaged in negotiations to turn them into production customers. During that phase, that customer is not considered a customer. It effectively falls off the calculation. And then when they would enter into a production deal, they come back into the calculation. So those dynamics are still at play because obviously, we still have a tail of the former trial model at the -- during the quarter. Now the 17 new pilot arrangements, those also are a mixture of new customers and then we could have an existing customer who wants to do a trial project with us. So that would be -- that could be part of the bridge as well.\nMike Cikos: Got it. Got it. And one other thing, if I could, but I know you guys obviously cited the better profitability here versus expectations. And one of the -- I guess there were two primary big drivers. The first is we had a large sequential uptick in the pro services revenue and that pro services gross margin. Can you help us think about what drove that strong return in pro services as well as the gross margin there coming in, it was in the 90% plus range, which I think was much higher than what you guys have typically done. Was there any onetime item that benefited that gross margin?\nJuho Parkkinen: So we have a highly skilled professional services organization, and we do various projects where we are able to command a high margin. Our standard kind of historical implementation services would be at a lower margin, but then we also do certain consulting base or more ad hoc projects that carry a very high gross margin.\nMike Cikos: Okay. And then the other thing that benefited the margins obviously was the much lower than expected sales and marketing expense. What was it that drove that benefit? And I guess the follow-up question on sales and marketing is, I know that you guys have previously outlined your assumptions for sales and marketing headcount to grow 40% to 60% year-to-year. Are we tracking to that? Where did the sales and marketing headcount shake out for the quarter?\nJuho Parkkinen: Okay. Thanks, Mike. That's another great question on that. So if you take a look at the investor supplement, we broke it out again for your benefit between sales and marketing. So you can kind of see the relative proportion there and how we plan on how our current plan is to track into operating profit. To answer kind of quickly to your question, from a marketing perspective, as discussed in prior calls, we believe we have a very high brand value, and we no longer have to spend the historical amounts to gain or increase that value. And secondly, on the sales side, we have very aggressive hiring targets, but we are slightly behind those targets because we look for the best type of candidates to sell our products and services.\nOperator: Thank you and one moment for our next. Our next question comes from the line of Gil Luria with D.A. Davidson. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nGil Luria: It looks like the general AI conversation, you were ahead of. Can you help us a little bit with the context for that? When did you start the work on that? When did the pilot start? You talked about a couple of implementations maybe a preview of what you're going to talk next week about at your conference. It seems like there's a little confusion out there about what came first, the interest in generative AI or your work on it. So would you mind walking us through that time line?\nTom Siebel: Let me try that. And this is Tom. So we've been working with generative AI models since 2020. What precipitated this particular spurt of creativity was there a quest from DoD, which is one of our larger customers. And I got a text about four or five months ago, but Tom, we need you to be the Google for DoD. And so I didn't quite understand what that meant. And then I talked to some of our colleagues and like General Hyten those we used to be the Vice Chairs of Joint Chiefs; and General Cardon, who is the Chair of our Federal -- United States Army Cyber Command, is the Chairman of CTV Federal. And they said, \"Tom, this the way it works. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs asked some question in the meeting like how are we doing against our diversity goals or what is our satellite coverage into Paycom.\" Okay? They then that gets passed down to 22 stars goes to four corporals, goes to 16 IP people. And four weeks later, somebody goes back with two PowerPoint slides in the Joint Chiefs meeting. That's really how it works. So when we were thinking about Google for DoD. I mean the way they phrased the question really facilitated the creative process. So, Ed and I and a couple of other people got together in a room when we started to say Google for DoD, what does that mean? Well, Google, if you think about the Google human interface, Okay. That's the one in the interface that everybody in the world knows how to use, okay, is basically the search bar. And we figured out a way to use that for every application we do, DoD, manufacturing, supply chain precision health demand forecasting where you simply type in the question, what's my satellite coverage on into Paycom. It uses generative AI to say, did you mean this or this, just like Google does. You click on the answer you do that you and it uses normal AI to give you the answer. It uses kind of check the capability to give you a detailed explanation on the right, with which you can interact via chat. Okay. Understand though, the chat universe that you know about is only the information content of the enterprise that were installed, be it Dow, be it EY or be at a Department of the Army. And then below, you get a log of last of other areas that you might want to click on that are related to the question, whatever the question was semi coverage into Paycom. These might be share files, click files, XL files documents, what have you. So we put that together and start playing with it. And then we develop some techniques that by combining enterprise search with indexation processing and generative AI, reinforcement learning and it's kind of the Google user interface in a very non-IPS manner, we're able to solve a very interesting problem or now we have an application that the share joint chiefs can use at the end of the and the private and the flight line at right patterns and Air Force base can use. So there's a link in our news release. We can go on and see the application. And I think this might fundamentally change the nature of the human computer interface anise applications. It's pretty neat. And what we'll be showing it in Florida next week to our users working on about 10 of our applications. and releasing it into production this spread. So it's we didn't advent generative AI. We're just taking advantage of the billions of dollars of research that's going on out there. And whoever has the hottest product of the day, be it Microsoft or Google or Open AI or whoever it comes up with it next, we just use that in our engine and our architecture supports that. So, sorry for the long answer, but it is really exciting, and I encourage you to click on the link on our news release, and there's about a four-minute demo there that will give you a feel for it. I think you'll think it's unique, has a lot of utility and will dramatically increase the usability and attractiveness of our products.\nGil Luria: My follow-up is it sounds like you're talking about two things. One, about how generative makes your current products we better and another how you can apply it in an enterprise level beyond your product set to other data sets within the enterprise, which one is the bigger commercial opportunity?\nTom Siebel: That's a really good question. And I mean you really asked a good question. And because there is a big opportunity to do this in enterprises that do not use C3 and do not intend to use C3, okay? But they want the unified view of their data. And so the honest answer is we have not figured out how to monetize that yet. We haven't put a price on it yet, but there is potentially a very large market there. And it's no place -- it's not in any of our operating plans yet, but it will be. But you -- this is a very -- it's a non-obvious use of these open IR lips. This is not about Chat GPT a chat. It's kind of cute, right? And someday, I think it will be useful. But that's -- we're not doing chat here. We're doing kind of the antithesis of chat. We're using these large language models to basically crawl the enterprise. And so -- but you asked a very good question. There is a monetization opportunity today that we haven't figured out yet.\nOperator: Thank you and one moment for our next. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Turits with KeyBanc. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nMichael Turits: Tom, just to continue on the product front and then I had a question or two for you, but on the product on generative today, I think it's it makes a lot of sense to the combination and the story with DoD. I guess the question is you're basically enterprise search that you're talking about, which is the name of the product. But that's not unless I'm wrong, was that a product you had before because that's obviously a market unto itself, and there's a lot of existing players in that market. So what's the history of having developed that?\nTom Siebel: What is an example of an enterprise product in the market?\nGil Luria: Even like what Elastic does for a lot of people, right? So -- and then how are you -- what's the sort of the innovation that allows you to interact that with other people's generative AI models?\nTom Siebel: The innovation is the way that we have combined those core technologies in a new and novel approach for a non-obvious application, okay? So something that would define what's patentable, okay? So we're taking the enterprise search UI NLP degenerative AI, reinforcement learning and predictive analytics and combining those in a non-obvious way to solve a problem of how utility. Ed, why don't you pick it up from there?\nEd Abbo: Yes. So as Tom said, basically, we're using more modern techniques than, say, Elastic to do the interpretation of the questions using large language models and then the retrieval of information from across the enterprise information systems, documents, BI dashboards, et cetera. And so this is a, as Tom said, a novel approach to be able to search the entire corpus of an enterprise and leverages generative AI, leverages these large language models and all the all of the capability that we've developed over the past decade to be able to integrate and unified data across systems, sensor networks, images, tax, et cetera. So this is different than it's new, and it's much more effective than traditional approaches for indexing.\nMichael Turits: Got it. Makes sense. And then just on Baker Hughes. So I think that we had in our model, I don't know if it's right or not, but I think we're anticipating about another $270 million in the contracts? Maybe -- I don't know if you wanted to update that, but so do I just add $35 million to that? And does it change the amount you're expecting each quarter? And what did you get this quarter from them?\nJuho Parkkinen: Okay. Good question. So I'd have to -- I think we need to look at your model effort. But the short answer is that we disclose both in our release and the Q and the supplement, the Baker Hughes RPO, the RPO is $188.5 million. So we've got to maybe check on offline as to what does that mean for your model. As it relates to the results in the quarter on the face of the income statement, we showed a related party amount for Baker Hughes this quarter was $28.9 million.\nMichael Turits: Okay. Great. And does it extend the amount of time? I think you said it extended the dollar amount maybe I missed it, but is it extending the period over which it's being paid also so adding through the same length?\nJuho Parkkinen: Actually, one of the really exciting seas part of this extended agreement is that we accelerated the payment schedules. So we're actually collecting cash faster from Baker Hughes. And then as it relates to the transaction price, so the accounting transaction price increased by $32.5 million because the variable consideration was eliminated as part of the expansion deal.\nTom Siebel: And I think it might have -- I might be in a source of a little bit confusion there, Michael. Another term of it is they have a unilateral option to extend the agreement, okay, should they choose to do so. That doesn't mean to extend the period of the payment terms. That means add more years to the agreement for pre-existing predetermined amounts of cash.\nOperator: Thank you and one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Sanjit Singh with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nSanjit Singh: So, if I take the comments from Tom in his script and Tom's like notable that you are speaking to a better demand environment and I think the rest of software is still pretty gloomy. And then I sort of Juho's comments around the consumption actual versus predicted sort of coming in line with what you thought, I try to put these pieces together revenue is declining year-over-year right now, obviously, because the business model is going through some transition. And so I guess the big question is, what -- where does revenue growth go to? I know you guys still have another quarter to go before your Q4, but The Street is sort of expecting 20% revenue growth. Is that something that seems achievable from your line of sight and more optimistic view? Is it something better than that, below that? I'm just trying to understand like where the business is.\nTom Siebel: Juho will this Sanjit, but just for the record, if I'm not mistaken, our revenue for fiscal year '23 will be greater than fiscal year '22, not less. Okay? So year-over-year our revenue will increase, not decrease. So, I just want there to be any misunderstanding about the listing. Juho, why don't you take the rest of it?\nJuho Parkkinen: Yes, of course, yes. So thanks, Sanjit. The -- let me try to recap your question. So first of all, as Tom mentioned that the annual guide would be a year-over-year increase on the total annual results. And then on the quarterly basis, yes, we're seeing very promising signs that our model assumptions are good. We're seeing actual results that are at the model or even better. And previously, we have provided some really early onset outlook that 24% would be around 30% growth. I know that the Street expects around 20% growth, I'd say that it's achievable at least to what the Street is saying and we certainly are interest -- we certainly are targeting a higher growth so our model actuates as we plan it to actually.\nSanjit Singh: No, that's super helpful. I really appreciate the thoughts. And I guess, Thomas, a follow-up on just your more optimistic view versus, let's say, a year ago, where is that coming from, like, I mean, is there a way you can sort of talk to it from like a vertical perspective. A lot of the companies that are struggling now are selling to other tech companies, which kind of explains a lot of their weakness. But what are you seeing in your customer base?\nTom Siebel: The only good question. Maybe you -- I guess you can't show the slide. But if you show the industry diversity, I mean, number one, oil and gas is obviously a very healthy segment for us, but it's one of the healthiest segments in the overall economy, right? So we happen to be in the right place at the right time there with the right partner. That's working out pretty well for us. But if you look at -- Juho, please talk to the industry diversification that we saw in the pilot projects because it's really kind of all segments of the economy. I mean all I can say, Sanjit, is like when we go to places like Davos or I go to the U.K. or I go to Washington, D.C. or I get to New York. I mean, last summer, I mean it was the end of the world in July and August, everybody is hunkered down in the basement, figuring out how seriously they were going to slash expenses to like survive the recession. Now it's kind of everybody and think, okay, fine, there's going to be a recession, let's get over it and get on with business. And so it's -- there's just a dramatically improved sentiment out there. And -- but Juho maybe you can comment on the of the diversity that we saw in the pilot because it was really quite remarkable.\nJuho Parkkinen: Yes. Thanks, Tom. So Sanjit, on the supplemental or the supplement that we have on our website, if you check out Slide 24, we show the diversity in total bookings, and then we also show the diversity of the pilot bookings. So we're very excited about the nine industries that we have pilot deals during the quarter. Just to rattle them off, we got fed accounting services, consumer packaged goods, manufacturing, we've got oil and gas, financial services, high tech, we've got telco, and then we have state and local. So we've got a diverse group here.\nSanjit Singh: Yes. I guess the point would be is that...\nTom Siebel: The number remains a very small slice of our business, unlike a lot of software companies.\nSanjit Singh: Yes, yes. That's right. And I guess the point Juho would be -- I guess, not just the diversification, right? But the theme across a lot of software for the past couple of quarters is that people are just conservative with respect to their investments, particularly with like public cloud related investments because they spent a lot of that in the last two years. It sounds like what you're saying is that you are detecting no such hesitation within the CI specific customer base they are in investment mode and would that be a fair characterization?\nJuho Parkkinen: From my perspective, and I think maybe Tom could shed some light or Ed, but I certainly believe and have seen from our customer base that our products provide value to customers. there's efficiencies, there's more productivity. So when you have whatever market, whatever industry you have, everybody is interested in cutting costs and become more profitable, become more efficient we are right there. Our stuff is helping them to get business value very quickly. Maybe, Ed, do you want to maybe shed something on that?\nTom Siebel: In the qualified pilot opportunities that we're working and it was Google alone were in the process of trying to close deals with how many. It's a big member. We are engaged, okay? We have 291. Well, we have over 100 opportunities with Google Cloud, and we're currently engaged in licensing discussions. I mean, something changed, Sanjit, from July of 2022. That's it.\nOperator: Thank you and one moment for our next question. The next question comes from the line of Arvind Ramnani with Paper Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nArvind Ramnani: I wanted to ask about your expanded partnership with Google and also AWS. When you look at these partnerships, how are you sort of measuring kind of the commercial success or the ROI of these relationships, right? Because you let have like a lot of good relationships and kind of partnerships we have established and have continued to expand and -- but sort of looking forward and saying like, these are the partnerships that are resulting in the greatest commercial success, and this is where we need to continue investing in. How are you -- what's the approach in figuring out that ROI and investment?\nTom Siebel: In the short term, we're measuring on pilots closed. Looking in the medium term, we're measuring it on consumption, okay? The reason that AWS and Google and others are partnering with us and the hyperscale is they're partnering with us is because we accelerate consumption. In other words, the customer doesn't have to spend two years building the ML application or at which time they're not consuming a lot of CPU cycles or building the supply risk application or whatever it might be the also a consume happen fast. That's what these guys are interested in, okay? They're interested in CPU cycles and storage hours. These are short term or measured in pilots, medium and long term were measured in BCD hours.\nArvind Ramnani: Terrific. And then just on the kind of macro kind of commentary, you certainly kind of early kind of talking about some of the headwinds, and again, you're talking about those headwinds turning into tailwinds. Do you have kind of -- are you seeing enough of signs to kind of confidently say that things are turning around? Or is it still -- we're at a point where things could go in either direction?\nTom Siebel: Well, you're an expert at this and we're not, Sanjit. But the -- we were one of the earliest I think, to call that it was really ugly out there. then everybody else filed on, but then everybody else started doing layoffs, 5%, 10%, 20% at a time and those aren't over yet. All I can say is what we're seeing now is dramatically different. And I was I mean, I didn't say that to pump our stock price. I was just telling you guys what was really going on in the market, okay? And I'm telling you what's really going on in the market. Now I don't know whether this is a femoral or whether this is going to -- whether this is going to be sustained. This is -- but I think that the way this looks to me is sooner or later, the Fed is going to take its foot off the brakes okay? When the Fed takes its foot off the brakes, this will be a cash positive rapidly growing business, okay? And I think we're going to be off to the races. Now I don't know you guys have big mines that now when the Fed is going to take it off the brakes. I don't know when that is, okay? But when that is, that's what we will be, whether this thing could take a dip or not, that's beyond my pay grade, buy. I just know that right now, something has changed.\nOperator: Thank you and one moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Kingsley Crane with Cannaccord. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nKingsley Crane: Tom, so I appreciated your comments on the applicability of the generative AI product outside of the typical customer base. But we just think about the core customer base, what do you think the potential is for generative AI to drive new trials? Or is this primarily a product that would work best as sort of second, third or fourth product within the basin?\nTom Siebel: I tell you, go look at the demo. People get awfully excited about it. And I just came back from somewhere. I know where Barcelona, okay, I just got off a plane from Barcelona, it shows to a bunch of people, Ed and I. And it's a pretty exciting product. It's something brand new. And you got to just take a look at it. It's hard to describe. And I think it will make our products more attractive. It will make it easier for people to use, easier to handle change management, which is everything in enterprise applications. And so -- and it will, I think, substantially differentiate us in the market. Take a look at this user interface compared to what SAP, Oracle, Salesforce and everybody else has in the market, which is just kind of a cheap copy of the Cboe version of the 7 architecture that Ed and I embedded in 2002. And this is something very different, and the excitement appears to be palpable.\nKingsley Crane: We've seen the demo we're definitely really impressed by it. And so one for Juho. Wherever growth ends up next year in fiscal '24, just want to think a little bit more about the balance of existing customer expansion and then the net new customer deals, like how much of the ramp in trial conversions are we factoring into growth next year?\nJuho Parkkinen: Okay. Great question. So, I would suggest that you take a look at the assumptions that we provided and you model out based on the actuals that we have provided. And that just kind of give you a good idea as to where we should be as it rebates to the consumption-based business and happy to chat with you if you have any additional questions on it.\nOperator: Thank you and one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Pat Walravens with JMP Securities. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nPat Walravens: Great. Tom, one for you first. Can you just sort of give us an overview of how the business with the DoD is going? And maybe as a touch point to that, in December 2021, you guys signed the $500 million production other transaction agreements. How much of that is the DoD actually taken down? How much of the $500 million do they spend?\nTom Siebel: A good question, Pat, and I don't know the answer. We have two agreements like that. One is for $500 million is one for $100 million. And I'm not sure I can tell you that our business with the DoD is looking very promising. There's -- I think we had -- we hosted -- Ed and I hosted, I think, A very large number of CIOs from DoD like two weeks ago on Army, Navy, Air Force, Cyber Command, Spacecom, Marines, National Guard, they were all in our office. And there are lots of discussions going on about some very significant projects. And so DoD is looking very promising. But I don't know the answer to how much of that deal we've taken out. And we have a proposal in front of one of the agencies that will consume a lot of it, and we'll see what happens.\nPat Walravens: Hopefully, that gets done. All right. And then Juho, I just wanted to -- it was a very simple math there. But if I look at your Slide 20 I mean if I take your average TCV and I multiply it by the number of deals that you have for each quarter on the chart, I get your total bookings, right?\nJuho Parkkinen: Yes. I think Pat that sounds about the right math, yes.\nPat Walravens: Right. That seems reasonable. So you had 27 deals in Q3 at $1.9 million. So that's $51 million in bookings. And you had 20 deals in basically a year ago, right, at $5.6 million each, $112 million. So booking has been cut by more than half. Is that a fair assessment of what's really going on?\nTom Siebel: Let's also put this in -- I'll let Juho answer this, but I understand a year ago, the deals were $10 million, $20 million, $30 million, $40 million, $50 million deals. This quarter, as a result to consumption-based pricing, the $0.5 million trials. So then this gets into, as Juho explained. So you all take it from there, okay? But so in a completely different kind of deal, and in the quarters going forward, you'll see we're closing a lot more of them. But we're not closing our old model used to be $10 million, $20 million, $50 million, $20 million, $30 million, $40 million, $50 million. We don't do those anymore. We're doing $0.5 million deals. Juho?\nJuho Parkkinen: Yes. Thanks, Tom. Yes, Pat, I think Tom summarized it perfectly. This is totally expected, and this is a direct result of the consumption-based pricing shift two quarters ago.\nPat Walravens: Right? So I mean it's great transparency, right? Most companies don't give us their total bookings. So as long as you guys keep getting these slides, we're going to be able to keep doing the math. When do you think we start seeing that go up?\nJuho Parkkinen: So if you now -- since you have that chart open, I'm glad to hear it, go to Slide 18, and on Slide 18, what you see is the same chart that we provided to the last three quarters that shows the kind of the expected consumption revenue model ramp-up versus subscription ramp-up. So this is an indicative of what we would expect to see. And as I've outlined, we believe we are in our model that we've outlined to you guys, so we can kind of figure out from here when we should start seeing the ramp up.\nPat Walravens: Yes, seven quarters through? And where are we now?\nJuho Parkkinen: So we would have started two quarters ago. So based on this, we are at -- for the first quarter, second, we're on quarter three.\nOperator: Thank you and one moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Arsenije Matovic with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nArsenije Matovic: This is Arsenije on for Gal. It seems like this is now two quarters of coming in above expectations that were initially communicated for progress in the pilot initiative. Should we think about these pilots coming in faster than your initial communication suggested, given the more positive macro outlook you're seeing relative to the first quarter? And then I had one brief follow-up.\nJuho Parkkinen: I think, Arsenije, like I said, the original assumptions that we provided are still valid. We're seeing great results. We're very excited with the traction with our partners and the number of deals that we're tracking, but we're quite confident with our model at this time.\nArsenije Matovic: Got it. That's helpful. And then what caused the large services contribution from Baker Hughes in the quarter? It looks like it was $8.6 million. Did this contribute to the above 90% services gross margin? And can you remind us how COGS associated with Baker Huge service revenue is accounted for?\nJuho Parkkinen: Perfect. So I think you missed the initial call or initial question for Mike who asked this, and I explained the gross margin impact. But just as a quick recap for you, we have various types of professional services, and we have highly skilled workforce, and we're able to command good premium on those services. And Baker Hughes is one of customers, many customers whom we -- which provide professional services.\nReuben Gallegos: Operator, we'll just take one last quick call again.\nOperator: And our last question is a follow-up question from the line of Michael Turits with KeyBanc. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nMichael Turits: Thanks, gentlemen, for letting me get a follow-up. And the guide for next quarter of the $70 million to $72 million, you have that big bump in services, which seem to have come back faster than I think we might have expected. Any sense you can give us for what the trends are for both subscription and services into next quarter, the subscription trend down, flat services to high?\nJuho Parkkinen: I think we've historically provided that our target is between 10% and 20%, and I think we're going to be in that range quite nicely.\nOperator: Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions. And I'd like to hand the conference back to Juho Parkkinen for any further remarks.\nJuho Parkkinen: Awesome. So thanks, everybody, for joining for our third quarter conference call, and we really look forward to chatting with you guys all in the future and thank you for your time.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "AI", "quarter": 2, "year": 2023, "date": "2022-12-07 21:29:04", "content": "Operator: Hello, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the C3 AI Second Quarter Fiscal Year Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to introduce from [technical difficulty] Investor Relations, Mr. Reuben Gallegos.\nReuben Gallegos : Thank you, Andrew, and good afternoon, and welcome to C3 AI's earnings call for the second quarter of fiscal year 2023, which ended on October 31, 2022. My name is Reuben Gallegos, and I'm the Vice President of Investor Relations. With me on the call today is Tom Siebel, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Juho Parkkinen, Chief Financial Officer. After the market closed today, we issued a press release with details regarding our second quarter results as well as a supplemental to our results, both of which can be accessed through the Investor Relations section of our website at ir.c3.ai. This call is being webcast, and a replay will be available on our IR website following the conclusion of the call. During today's call, we will make statements related to our business that may be considered forward-looking under federal securities laws that reflect our views only as of today and should not be considered representative of our views as of any subsequent date. We disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements or our outlook. These statements are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. For a further discussion of the material risks and other important factors that could affect our actual results, please refer to our filings with the SEC. All figures will be discussed on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Also during the course of today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in our press release. Finally, at times in our prepared remarks, in response to your questions, we may discuss metrics that are incremental to our usual presentation to give greater insight into the dynamics of our business or quarterly results. Please be advised that we may or may not continue to provide this additional detail in the future. And with that, let me turn the call over to Tom.\nTom Siebel : Thank you, Reuben, and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us. I'm here with Juho Parkkinen, our Chief Financial Officer, and we are most pleased to share our results for the second quarter for fiscal year '23. Bottom line, it was a solid quarter in which we delivered our stated objectives and met expectations despite the rocky economic situation and the generally morose condition of the markets. In the last earnings call, we described two strategic initiatives to spur faster growth. One was to recompose our sales team with an emphasis on technical and domain expertise. The second was to shift our pricing model from a subscription-based pricing model to a consumption-based pricing model. I'm happy to report these initiatives have been successfully completed in the second quarter. I will explain these actions in some detail, but first, I'll comment on the financial results and some of the successes that we achieved during the quarter. With large, the quarter was quite solid. Subscription revenue for the quarter was $59.5 million, an increase of 26% year-over-year. Operating loss improved 15 points year-over-year to 24%. We continue to maintain a healthy gross margin of 77%. Customer comp grew 16% year-over-year to 236. Current RPO of $164.5 million was down slightly and consistent with our expectations as we transition to a consumption-based pricing model. We ended the quarter with cash reserves of approximately $860 million. The number of completed contracts in the quarter increased to 25, approximately a 100% increase year-over-year. Our average contract value in the second quarter was just over $800,000, down from $19 million a year earlier. This reduction in contract value was a direct result of our new pricing model. We believe the new pricing model will result in a substantially increased number of smaller transactions, providing greater forward visibility in both revenue and bookings. Our new consumption-based pricing model was well-received by our customers, our prospects, our partners and by our sales organization. We expect this new model to increase the number of customers with which we engage in any given quarter by an order of magnitude. As these customers continually increase their usage over time, we expect the compound effect on revenue growth to be quite significant. Our customers and prospects find a new consumption-based pricing easier to understand and easier to contract. Our market partners find this new pricing model well-aligned with how they price their own services and one that facilitates their successfully selling C3 AI products. I'm happy to report that our transition to this new consumption-based pricing model is now complete. Simultaneously, last quarter, we completed a transition of similar magnitude with the recomposition of our global sales team. We are now growing a team of highly qualified, well-trained technologically expert sales professionals, who are engaging with prospective customers in selling pilots and expanding production usage with existing customers.  There is no question that there is pervasive economic uncertainty in the global business community that continues to provide bookings headwinds. This has been especially significant in the tech markets that are experiencing a blood bath in equity prices, with significant layoffs at companies, including Amazon, Meta, Salesforce, Google, Snap and many others. I believe this is just the start of what will be a significant tech market correction. Layoffs of established companies will accelerate. The many Series A, B, C and D companies that are hemorrhaging cash will simply not survive. Just like every other tech recession that we're seeing, the human capital at the piece parts companies will be redistributed to those companies that survive. We are confident in our business outlook, especially with the nearly $600 billion addressable market opportunity that we have before us. We continue to invest in our products and in the talent required to meet our goal of building a cash positive profitable business that will return to a growth rate of greater than 30% year-over-year within the next 18 months. Our employee base grew last quarter to over 850, a sequential increase of 83, and we continue to hire key engineers, data scientists, sales professionals and other key roles across the organization. Turning to some of our customer successes in the quarter. Shell has continued to expand their use of our solutions in new areas, and have successfully implemented C3 AI sustainability for manufacturing at two of their key offshore platforms in the Gulf of Mexico. We also have successfully concluded an ESG trial with Shell, with focus on leveraging NLP to generate targeted insights on the rapidly evolving ESG priorities of Shell's key stakeholders. Shell has already addressed and communicated that they are realizing massive economic value annually by deploying our C3 AI applications across the enterprise, upstream, downstream, midstream renewables. We're just getting started. There's a large and growing pipeline of enterprise AI applications that Shell is building, testing and deploying using the C3 AI platform, realizing the strategic value of our partnership and the fulfillment of the digital transformation of one of the largest and most iconic companies in the world. Cargill has continued to expand their use of our solutions and optimizing food production and distribution to meet the dynamic needs of the market and ensuring sustained food value chains in North America, Latin America, Europe, Africa and Asia. This is a critical mission that has enormous humanitarian ramifications, and we are proud to participate with Cargill in this important mission. Lastly, we are proud to say that we've continued to expand our relationship with the United States Air Force, working closely with them to improve aircraft availability and efficiency of readiness programs of the entire fleet of over 3,700 aircraft. The AI capabilities that we are putting into operation today offers the potential to improve readiness rates by up to 20% and reduce the cost of maintenance for up to $4 billion per year. Let me address our partner ecosystem. In recent weeks, there's been something of a seismic shift in the enterprise AI software space. Traditionally, the primary competition to purchasing C3 AI enterprise applications was the license -- was for a company to -- the alternative of C3 AI was for a company to license a large number of tools from the hyperscalers, piece parts from providers like Cloudera, Pivotal, DataBridge, DataRobot and the many of the scores of other point solution providers, and then engage in a long and expensive science experiment in an attempt to build a custom enterprise AI platform. No one to our knowledge ever succeeded with that. Now the market is truly changing due to -- changing and demonstrating an increased desire for production, tried, tested, proven enterprise AI solutions. All of the hyperscalers have acknowledged this within the last few months. Thomas Kurian at Google Cloud was the leader, announcing the GCP would lead in the market, okay, not with piece parts, but with turnkey production enterprise applications from C3 AI. Then last week, Adam Selipsky, CEO of AWS, announced that their customers were now demanding turnkey applications, not toolkits. This was followed the next day by Scott Guthrie, EVP of Microsoft Azure. All announced that the customers were telling them they no longer wanted toolkits to build applications, they now want functional turnkey AI applications that accrue immediate value. With a growing family of 42 production enterprise C3 AI applications in the market that serve the needs of financial services, utilities, health, manufacturing, defense, intelligence and other industries, C3 AI is well positioned to capitalize on this now clearly recognized market requirement. We sell it with GCP. We sell with Azure. We sell with AWS. We sell with Baker Hughes. We sell with Booz Allen Hamilton. And we are well positioned to help our partners to deliver to their customers the solutions they are demanding. C3 AI and Google Cloud are continuing to jointly invest in industry applications with the launch of two new enterprise AI applications last quarter optimized on GCP. Our sales teams are actively co-selling today to over 300 accounts around the world. Last quarter, we closed an expansion with a large transportation company, currently signed one of the top 50 retailers in the world to license our supply chain applications and signed several new deals in the financial services and oil and gas industries. Our GCP joint selling activity is quite brisk, and as a result, GCP is our fastest growing install base. That being said, AWS remains C3 AI's largest installed base, constituting about 56% of our customer base. C3 AI and Microsoft continue to close deals, particularly in the energy and manufacturing sectors. Azure remains our second largest installed base, constituting approximately 27% of our customer base. We announced a number of new product enhancements here in the course of the quarter that I'm not going to review in this call, but we continue to invest in technology leadership. We continue to invest in R&D and we'll continue to add to our industry-leading portfolio of enterprise AI applications and add fair debt and increased performance to these existing applications. Let me talk for a minute about human capital. C3 AI continues to be recognized as a Great Place to Work. In the second quarter, we received over 23,000 job applications. We interviewed over 2,200 of these applicants, and we hired 90. One of the secular changes of this tech downturn is the increased availability of highly trained professionals who are willing to come into the office, roll up their sleeves and get to work. We have never been more confident with the team that we have and with their ability to execute our strategy. Turning to guidance. Our Q3 revenue is expected to be between $63 million and $65 million, and we are reaffirming our full year fiscal year '23 revenue guidance of $255 million to $270 million. For non-GAAP operating loss, we expect in Q3 between $25 million and $29 million. And for the full year, we expect an operating loss between $85 million and $98 million. We continue to operate at roughly an 80% non-GAAP gross profit margin. We have a clear path to top line growth, non-GAAP profitability and a cash positive operations by the end of fiscal year '24. At this time, we did not see our cash balances below -- we did not see our cash balances falling below $700 million before that inflection. Final comment on the big picture. C3 AI is addressing a $600 billion addressable AI software market. If not the largest, we are one of the largest providers of these applications globally. Our business is exactly on track with what we have communicated to you. Our goal remains to establish and maintain a global leadership position in enterprise AI software. In the short run, we believe tech companies and tech equities will continue to face headwinds, as long as the Fed keeps its foot on the brake. The collateral damage, I think, is going to be more significant than people think. That being said, when the Fed takes its foot off the brake, be that in 2023 or 2024, C3 AI will be bigger, stronger, cash positive, profitable, a clear market leader and well positioned to benefit from the inevitable equity market surge that will ensue. Now let me turn the call over to our CFO, Juho Parkkinen, for a summary of our financials and additional commentary. Juho?\nJuho Parkkinen : Thank you, Tom. Now I will provide a recap of our financial results, add some color to the drivers of our financials for the back half of the year and conclude with some additional color related to the consumption-based revenue model we introduced on our last call. As Tom mentioned, we ended the quarter with revenue of $62.4 million, which represents 7% year-over-year growth. Subscription revenue increased by a solid 26% and was 95% of total revenues. Gross profit increased 5% to $47.8 million, and gross margin decreased 122 basis points to 76.6%. The decline is primarily due to a higher mix of trials and pilots, which carry a higher cost required to ensure customer success during this early phase of engagement. Operating loss of $15 million improved $7.6 million year-over-year, and operating loss margin also improved from 39% in the prior year to 24% in Q2. Our customer count increased by 16% year-over-year to 236, and we closed 25 deals during the quarter. It's noteworthy that deals under $1 million grew 167 year-over-year in Q2. Now turning to RPO and bookings. We reported RPO of $417.3 million, which met our expectations as we continue to convert to consumption-based deals. Current RPO was $164.5 million, down 8% from last year. We continue to see positive trends in bookings diversity outside of oil and gas, particularly in the Federal, aero and defense sectors, which grew sequentially and year-over-year. Turning to cash flow. Free cash flow for the quarter was an outflow of $77 million. Breaking this down, $23.7 million was for the build-out of our new headquarters. As I have mentioned previously, this will be amortized over the term of the lease and will not have a meaningful impact on our path to profitability. Normalizing for this payment, our adjusted free cash flow was an outflow of $54.3 million. Turning to guidance-related assumptions. As Tom mentioned, we have completed our transition from a subscription-based pricing model to a consumption-based pricing model and are now focused on ramping revenue from consumption-based deals. With respect to gross margin as the number of pilots ramp in the coming quarters and as the proportion of period revenue is more weighted towards pilots, we expect gross margin percentage to decline. However, consistent with the financial model we shared with you as part of the prior quarter earnings call, we expect the gross margin to increase to historical levels by the same time we expect to reach our initial non-GAAP profitability. Operating margin model and guidance includes our expectations for revenue growth and gross margin impact. Looking at our cash reserves, we have sufficient capacity to execute our plan to invest for growth in the coming quarters. We are well capitalized, having approximately $860 million available. With the planned expenditures related to the build-out of our new headquarters and investments in our business, we expect our cash investment balance to bottom out in fiscal '24 before we see improving free cash flow and improving cash balances thereafter. As a reminder, one of our most significant cash usages has been for the build-out of our new headquarters, which unlike many high-tech companies, we actually occupy. We are on track to achieve positive non-GAAP operating margin in the fourth quarter of the next fiscal year, driven by accelerating revenue growth and improving gross margin. Regarding the transition to consumption-based pricing, as a reminder, we do not require existing customers to move to a consumption-based arrangement. Our customers have been satisfied and are expected to remain in their current contract terms. As such, we expect the RPO to decline as our new deals will not require a significant upfront non-cancelable arrangement, but rather a consumption-based usage arrangement. The assumptions we provided last quarter for modeling the consumption-based business remain unchanged. In summary, we are focused on delivering profitable growth to our shareholders, and we continue to expect achieving non-GAAP profitability in the fourth quarter of fiscal '24, while growing the top line in excess of 30%. With these remarks, I would like to open the call up for questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank.\nBrad Zelnick : I guess my first one is either for you, Tom, or for Juho. Just as we think about the plan that you've laid out, and it's nice to see the progress relative to what you told us last quarter, but traditional metrics obviously don't tell the full story. So what's the right metric for us to track the progress quarter-to-quarter that you're making? What are the milestones that we should be looking for? And maybe can you tell us what metrics do you measure yourselves against internally and hold the sales force accountable to and incentivize them on so we can just get a sense quarter-to-quarter? In addition to customers, obviously, they eventually translate to dollars, but any insight there is helpful. And then I've got a follow-up.\nTom Siebel : Brad, it's Tom. I mean, I think the bottom line is when we go to this model, we're looking at a number of customers, okay? So how many new pilots are or closing every quarter? We'd expect in the other quarters, I mean, this should be in order of magnitude larger than we're doing now. I think we did, what, 13 or 15 last quarter in roughly half a quarter, because we announced the transition to this model about halfway through the quarter, and we did 15 in about half a quarter. So basically, it's really number -- we're really looking at a number of customers, Brad, and then we're looking at how far we -- how rapidly they grow the use of the products. If in fact, we get in order of magnitude more customers, and they continue to grow their use as our customers have in the past, and you know we've modeled this very carefully, I mean, we get out there three, four, five quarters. This revenue line should accelerate pretty dramatically.\nJuho Parkkinen : Right. Brad, just one thing to add to that. So we guided in our original model for the analyst community to expect five pilots for the quarter. We actually closed 13, which was a combination of trials and pilots. So we're quite excited about how this started, this kicked off.\nBrad Zelnick : That's helpful. And maybe just one follow-up. Appreciating the accelerated path to profitability and naturally, just given what's going on in the world, you guys are in in a pretty interesting position for sure. But what would need to happen to get you to positive free cash flow ahead of the fiscal '24 expectation? And maybe can you just clarify for us, is that an exit rate? Is that for the full year? How do we measure that? And what circumstances would maybe cause you to accelerate that? Not that you need to, you've got plenty of cash, but I mean, this is clearly the discipline that the world wants to see.\nTom Siebel : Brad, it's simple. We can turn this to be cash positive and profitable honestly within 90 days. All I got to do is layoff about 40% of the workforce, okay? I don't think -- I mean, that might make some analysts happy and it might make some shareholder happy, but it's absolutely not in the best interest of the shareholders, employees or the customers. But I mean, it's all we have to do is basically stop our marketing expenses and lost 40% of the people and I don't know whether it's 40% or 50% or 35%. But, I mean, hard stop, it's cash positive and profitable like this quarter. But I don't think that would be responsible, and I don't think it's anybody's interest, but you asked the question we gave you the answer. Juho, do you have any further light on that?\nJuho Parkkinen : Only thing, Brad, that we -- the way that we've modeled our path to profitability, we feel confident on that and we stick to that.\nBrad Zelnick : Got it. So just to clarify the expectation though, it's for the full year? Is it an exit rate when you say fiscal '24...\nTom Siebel : It\u2019s an exit rate of Q4 FY '24.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Mike Cikos with Needham & Company.\nMike Cikos : I did want to circle up on some of the customer count dynamics just because I know that is going to be 1 of the metrics we're looking at while you guys are going through this transition. I think you guys had cited 236 up from 228 last quarter, right? And I just wanted to see what has the customer behavior been like since you guys announced this transition? And what I really would be interested in hearing I know you guys are not forcing your customers to migrate down to the consumption model. But curious to hear, have you seen customers trade down to the consumption model since you announced this transition? And then the second question there is, have you seen any changes in customer behavior from a churn perspective?\nTom Siebel : Mike, it's Tom. No customer just in customer has requested to convert to the conversion base price -- the consumption-based pricing model. I understand that these customers are huge. I mean, you get in the Shell and you get into Koch, Baker Hughes, I mean, these are very, very large relationships now. And you can imagine their licensing terms are pretty favorable and unique to them. Have we seen any significant change in customer churn? No.\nMike Cikos : I appreciate the color there. And then for the follow-up, I did want to -- I guess looking back at what we had spoken about last quarter with deals getting pushed out, just given the current environment. So specifically, you guys had called out 66 deals last quarter getting pushed. Have you closed any of those deals in the interim? And do we still see a similar order of magnitude for deals getting pushed given that you guys have made this transition? Are you helping streamline the adoption process for those customers and accelerating those sales cycles?\nJuho Parkkinen : Mike, this is Juho. Yes, so we did close some of those deals that were pushed out of last quarter. And like we expected from our revenue guidance, the macroeconomic climate, was tougher for the second -- after Q1, but it has stabilized and in particular, with our new consumption-based pricing, I think our customers and potential new customers are reacting well to that strategy.\nMike Cikos : Got it. It makes a ton of sense, especially when I think about that average contract value declining from, call it, $19 million to less than $1 million this quarter.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Pinjalim Bora with JPMorgan.\nPinjalim Bora : I was talking to myself, I want to ask about the subscription revenue outperformance seems like a big outperformance in the quarter. Was that largely because of the outperformance in the number of pilots that you're doing? Because even if you have closed some of the deals that got pushed, I wouldn't have thought that you would recognize a ton of revenue from those. So help me understand that.\nTom Siebel : Well, I think you kind of got it. There were some previous transactions that were not based on consumption-based pricing but did close in the quarter. That did contribute to that. So I think you called it accurately, Pinjalim.\nPinjalim Bora : Okay. So it was because of the deals that closed. Okay. Tom, on a high level, maybe help us understand what are you hearing from CIOs in terms of IT budgets for next year. Are people -- you kind have called out, obviously, the headwinds on macro, but are you hearing people kind of resetting their budgets for next year, next calendar year? What are you hearing?\nTom Siebel : I think it's a really good question, and it varies from company to company. I mean, there are a lot of companies that see this as -- and organizations in the Federal government -- and by the way, I didn't comment on our Federal business, but our Federal business is really strong, okay? Particularly in the defense sector. And if you saw the defense budget, when he's flying through today, he increased, I think, almost over -- I'm sorry, $200 billion over last year, if I'm not mistaken. So that's a big business.  I think there's kind of two categories. There's companies that are like bearing down and using these technologies to figure out how to save money. That would include Shell. That would include the Air Force, okay? And then there's companies that whose name I will not mention, that are just absolutely going to the mat and slashing expenses on everything. They're going train the bunkers and they're going into recession mode, and we will see some customer churn from that, okay? Hard stop. Okay. And they're just cutting to the bone. And so these two classes of companies out there, those who are investing in savings and those who are just kind of going into a knee jerk, perfectly rational response to an impending significant recession and then just slashing all costs. And so we see both. And I don't know how long this lasts. You guys are the pros of this, whether it's 12 or 24 months. But when it's over, we're going to still be here if you don't plug it away at it. And -- but it's -- you cannot deny it. I mean, it is rocky out there.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Patrick Walravens with JMP Securities.\nPatrick Walravens : I want to do a couple of sort of financial ones to start with, if that's okay. So gross margin, if I'm looking at it right, non-GAAP was 77%, down from 81% last quarter. Is there anything worth noting there?\nJuho Parkkinen : Pat, it's Juho. The only thing to call out there is the trials and tickets, as Tom mentioned in the opening remarks, there is more higher cost than those than the ongoing subscriptions. So as we see increase of pilots and trials even in the coming quarters, we are expecting some pressure on gross margin before it climbs back up to historical levels.\nPatrick Walravens : Okay. So as I look forward, should I be around this 77 level?\nJuho Parkkinen : I think you should expect a little bit more of a pressure as we increase the pilot as a proportion of total deals. And by the time we are back at Q4 FY '24, we should be back at these rates and higher.\nPatrick Walravens : Okay. And then the subscription fee, but services missed at least my number by a lot and went down sequentially by a lot. What's to note there?\nJuho Parkkinen : Only thing to say, it's -- the services is a direct result of our transition to these pilots in our new consumption-based pricing model. There are minimal upfront big professional services deals associated with these. So as we -- as the pilots convert to ongoing license arrangements, we do expect the services component to increase as well. And in the second half of this fiscal year, we actually are expecting services to return back to the 10% to 20% of our total revenues.\nPatrick Walravens : So for Q3, it would be 10% to 20% of total revenue?\nJuho Parkkinen : I'm saying the full back half of the year. So it could be somewhere in the range for Q3 and higher or lower in Q4.\nPatrick Walravens : Okay. And then if you look at the subscription revenue of $59 million and change, the footnote says 32% of that is from related parties. Do you mind just explaining that for people, because I do get that question quite a bit?\nJuho Parkkinen : It's just the related party is relating to Baker Hughes. So Baker Hughes is our, of course, still a significant shareholder of C3 AI, and any revenues that we interact with Baker Hughes is direct purchases. We call them out in the financials.\nPatrick Walravens : Yes. And so Tom, the bear case would be that in some way is a lower quality revenue, what would your response be to that?\nTom Siebel : Oh, boy...\nPatrick Walravens : I'm not sure you have one, but...\nTom Siebel : I don't know how to respond, Pat. We're going to be doing a lot more deals, a lot more customers. We're going to convert a lot more of them into production, and they're going to grow just like Shell, Baker Hughes, Koch and everybody else has grown. And there's -- so right now, things are looking pretty promising. I think we're right on track.\nPatrick Walravens : Okay. Great. Last one, and this one is probably for you, Tom. So you signed -- it's been a year since you signed that $500 million production, other transaction agreement with the Department of Defense. How would you say it's going so far versus your original expectations?\nTom Siebel : DoD is really big. So I think that year-over-year, DoD grew by what percent?\nJuho Parkkinen : 100%.\nTom Siebel : Roughly 100%. 100% in terms of bookings. DoD is a real bright point, Pat, and you're talking specifically on MDA, the MDA agreement applies to all of DoD, by the way, okay? And then we have $100 million agreement with RSO, and you will announce not in this release, but tomorrow morning as the announcement about a big partnership that we're doing with Booz Allen Hamilton, okay, in all of the Federal, particularly DoD. But that business is looking strong.\nOperator: And our next question, Sanjit Singh with Morgan Stanley.\nUnidentified Analyst: Excellent. This is [Seaton] for Sanjit. I really just want to touch on sort of the consumption growth that you're seeing, especially with the Ex Machina product. Just if you can sort of provide any color on, one, how you see consumption trending with those customers? And then how you expect that going forward? And maybe sort of related to this environment, how are customers using it maybe differently than they have before?\nTom Siebel : Okay. Great. This is Tom. And I would say, of the various products that we have in the marketplace today, okay, of which we have, I think, 42 production products, Ex Machina being one of them, okay? We are underperforming on the execution of Ex Machina sales. It is a dramatically superior product to other products that are out there in the marketplace. That big set, it's kind of order of $1,000 thing, okay, in terms of the unit, okay? And we really haven't put the sales motion together to do that at scale. Now we've taken the objectives to get after it, but I cannot look you in the eye and say, that we're hitting that ball over the left field fast, because we're not, okay? And it's a great product. Our customers love it. We have somebody -- we have three customers that have much greater consumption whether...\nJuho Parkkinen : Baker Hughes and Con Edison almost 300% increase.\nTom Siebel : 300% increase there. But can I look you in and tell you that we're killing, that we're realizing the potential of that product, that product could be an entire separate company, okay? Our CRM product could be an entire separate company, our ESG product could be an entire separate company, stand-alone company. And in all three of those, I think we really need to get full it going, and we haven't done that yet.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. That's helpful. I mean, your commentary sounds worse than the 270% consumption increase that you're seeing there. Any color sort of on what's enabling that increase in consumption? And then two, how are you -- in your other products, like trying to enable similar consumption rates, is there anything sort of to highlight that you're doing differently there to get to those kind of trends that you're seeing in this product, although you're not highlighting it specifically?\nTom Siebel : Do you want to focus on Ex Machina -- or is it about Ex Machina or is this about overall products?\nUnidentified analyst: This is more broadly.\nTom Siebel : More broadly. Go ahead, Juho.\nJuho Parkkinen : No, I think, let me just kind of add on to that. So for Ex Machina, just what Tom said, we're still very early stages on that. So yes, we see those key customers that started early with us massive increase in consumption. Yes, we're excited about that. But that entire product is completely in its infancy, and we have high expectations on it. The other point on other consumption. So remember, again, we start these targets, the consumption deals start with a six-month pilot and then it moves into consumption. We started this quarter. So we're not really seeing any consumption until the initial six-month phases are complete. That question, and as we start talking about consumption under all the other deals that we do, we'll start reporting and discussing that more detail probably in Q1 next year.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Kingsley Crane with Canaccord Genuity.\nKingsley Crane : So for Tom, it looks like there's strong traction in Department of Defense, new and expanded deals with numerous agencies. Imagine the AI Defense Forum with a helpful touch point to close these through. So how would you characterize momentum in this sector? And then are these companies embracing the new consumption model? Or are they preferring to commit more upfront in the legacy model? [technical difficulty]\nOperator: I'm showing our next question comes from the line of Kingsley Crane.\nKingsley Crane : Yes. Could you hear me?\nTom Siebel: No. One more time, please.\nKingsley Crane : Okay. Right. So for Tom, looks like there was really strong traction in Department of Defense, expanded deals with numerous agencies. How would you characterize momentum in this sector compared to a few years ago? And then are these companies looking at the consumption model? Or are they primarily sticking to the current model?\nTom Siebel : Great question. It takes some time to really get traction in DoD, okay? And we've been working on that since 2014, okay, at the level of the Secretary of the Army and the Secretary of the Air Force and the joint chiefs and the -- and I mean, we've really been working it hard. I think we have 12 projects, all delivered on time, on budget to spec. And really, what we're finding is the consumption model there is really, really well received. They like it, okay? And they're kind of used to seeing these multibillion dollar juggernaut projects from the Lockheed Martins of the world or other providers, and we're coming in where, hey, we bring the project live for $0.5 million, and after that, $0.55 per CPU hour. It's like where do I sign?\" So there it's been very well received in that market.\nKingsley Crane : Okay. That's really great to hear. And then for you Juho, I just want to touch again on the services revenue, understandable that it would be lower given some of the trial like activity. So since we expect trials to continue in the new consumption model. Just trying to get a better handle on how quickly services should ramp back up to that 10% to 20%?\nJuho Parkkinen : Well, again, there's a component of the ongoing gradations with our existing customers and potential services engagements with them. And then our expectation of services engagements as these pilot deals convert to consumption deals. So what I was alluding to earlier to Pat's question, we are expecting services activity in the second half of this year. And then separately, in the long-term models, you should expect that as the pilots convert to consumption, there are services deals associated with those as well.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Arsenije Matovic with Wolfe Research.\nArsenije Matovic: This is Arsenije on for Gal. And I think on the call, you said there were 13 consumption pilot wins in the quarter, and maybe that was maybe better than you initially expected. Is that a run rate you're comfortable with going into the end of the fiscal year? The back half? And any particular call-outs for sectors where the consumption model is maybe getting better traction than you initially expected?\nJuho Parkkinen : So sorry, the second half of your question, it was a bit unclear, but let me address the first one. Yes, while we're excited on the beginning of this, so we did 13 pilot plant trials. So there's still a combination of some of the trials in there, but we do expect them to convert to a consumption-based arrangement at the end of the trial period. I do not -- we would not want to increase any of our assumptions in the model we shared with you last quarter. So even though we said 5 this quarter and we came in at 13, I want to keep the model as it was that we provided last quarter.\nArsenije Matovic: Great. And then just a brief follow-up. In terms of stock-based compensation, I think it's the second consecutive quarter where stock-based compensation as a percentage of sales is above 85%. I think in Q1, we talked about maybe that was a lot to do with share refreshers. And I wanted to see what dynamic was that happened in Q2. And what level of stock-based compensation should investors become comfortable with moving forward?\nJuho Parkkinen : Yes. I think broadly speaking, you see this across the industry. But stock-based compensation under GAAP is stuck with the grant date fair value of the underlying equity instrument. And as you obviously know, the history of the entire tech sector on C3 AI in the last 1.5 years, we are carrying significant stock-based compensation cost for awards that were granted when the share price was much higher than it is today. So unfortunately, there's nothing we can do about that unless the underlying employee decides to seek for other opportunities. So for now, until the end of these vesting terms for these awards, we are going to be carrying these pretty high stock-based compensation costs.\nTom Siebel : Never realized by the person who was granted the stock option. Never, but no time soon.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Adam Bergere, Bank of America.\nAdam Bergere: Great. This is Adam on for Brad. Juho for you, can you talk a bit about the shape of the revenue curve for next year? I guess, naturally, we expect it to kind of increase sequentially every quarter given the new sequential given the new consumption model. But is there a chance there's still some lumpiness in that, as you know, certain larger customers may renew on kind of like the non-consumption license?\nTom Siebel : Yes, I think the short answer to that is yes. And what we guided last quarter, we beat it for this quarter. Our guidance for next quarter, you see sequential increase and it does have the Q4 as an increase to that with respect to the implied guidance. The revenue curve is flattening as a result of the consumption-based pricing business model. But as we enter into it, in the short term, and as we enter into FY '24 and especially the second half of FY '24, you should start seeing the graph to get steeper and steeper in line with the presentation we shared last quarter.\nAdam Bergere: That's helpful. And then, again, just like the gross margin, could you kind of call out when that might trough out and what kind of like the level of that might be? I think it was at like 77% for this quarter. So is it fair to assume that that's kind of like a trough level for that?\nJuho Parkkinen : Well, thank you for the question. I think the more important thing is that we assume there would be a pressure in the gross margin when we provided the operating margin and operating profit guide and our path to profitability. So we are expecting pressure on it, but it doesn't change our path to profitability in 1 bit. So I cannot tell you exactly where I think it will dip down to, but I think in your models as you prepare the business back in FY '20 -- sorry, back when we hit FY '24, Q4, we should be back at 77-plus gross margin. So it may go down in the interim and then it comes back up as we enter profitability.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Arvind Ramnani with Piper Sandler.\nArvind Ramnani : I had a question on some of your kind of partnerships or alliances to help drive sales. Are you able to kind of dimension how much of your new sales or bookings come from in-house sales teams versus your partners? I'm sure it's probably pretty difficult to kind of bifurcate the 2. But if you're able to do that, that would be great. And on the same topic of partnerships, are the margins higher or lower on sales that are brought in by some of your partners?\nTom Siebel : Arvind, it's Tom. Virtually all of our sales today, we're selling with a partner, not through a partner, okay? And so that would be 100%, where we're selling with them. Now they may introduce us to the account. They may bring the executive team over here as Google has, as Booz Allen -- I'm sorry, as Baker Hughes has, as Microsoft has in the past like many, many times. But we're actively engaged, okay, in the sales process. Now we are just now putting our products on the marketplaces of the various hyperscalers. And so that dynamic might change going forward. But there's no margin difference because there is virtually no case where they're selling independently of us.\nOperator: Our next question and our last question comes from the line of Michael Turits with Keybanc.\nMichael Vidovic : This is Michael Vidovic on for Michael Turits. Could you just talk about linearity in the quarter and then trends you're seeing to start out November for fiscal 3Q?\nJuho Parkkinen : So are you talking about that deal velocity in the quarter? Or what are you asking about?\nMichael Vidovic : Yes. And just was it month-to-month, how do deals trend? Was it a constant uptick to reach throughout the quarter? Or was it stronger back end of the quarter or the beginning of the quarter?\nJuho Parkkinen : We see activity all throughout the quarter, but it's not unusual in this business where as you approach currently, you have slightly more activity.\nMichael Vidovic : Okay. And then just a quick follow-up on the vertical standpoint, particularly energy, have you seen like an uptick in deals in that area? And I guess, which areas besides Federal are you seeing particular strength in this time?\nJuho Parkkinen : So if your question is relating to the diversification of industries, we see continued diversification, which we're very excited about. Yes, there's deals in energy, but defense, as we discussed, is really exciting for us as many other industries as well. And we continue to expect more diversification with the consumption-based pricing and scores of new customers.\nTom Siebel : Okay. I guess that was our last question. And gentlemen, thank you for your thoughtful questions. And we appreciate the courtesy of you participating in our call. And we thank you all very much for your time.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating, and you may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "AI", "quarter": 1, "year": 2023, "date": "2022-08-31 21:15:24", "content": "Operator: Thank you for standing by, and welcome to the C3 AI First Quarter Fiscal Year 2023 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's program may be recorded.  And now I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Reuben Gallegos, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nReuben Gallegos: Thank you, and good afternoon, and welcome to C3 AI's earnings call for the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, which ended July 31, 2022. My name is Reuben, and I'm the Vice President of Investor Relations. With me on the call today is Tom Siebel, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Juho Parkkinen, Chief Financial Officer. After the market closed today, we issued a press release with details regarding our first quarter results, as well as a supplemental to our results, both of which can be accessed through the Investor Relations section of our website at ir.c3.ai. This call is being webcast, and a replay will be available on our IR website following the conclusion of the call. During today's call, we will make statements related to our business that may be considered forward-looking under federal securities laws. These statements reflect our views only as of today and should not be considered representative of our views as of any subsequent date. We disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements or outlook. These statements are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. For a further discussion of the material risks and other important factors that could affect our actual results, please refer to our filings with the SEC. Also during the course of today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in our press release. Finally, at times in our prepared remarks, in response to your questions, we may discuss metrics that are incremental to our usual presentation to give greater insight into the dynamics of our business or our quarterly results. Please be advised that we may or may not continue to provide this additional detail in the future. And with that, let me turn the call over to Tom.\nTom Siebel : Okay. Thank you, Reuben, and thank you all for joining the call today. I will apologize in advance for the unusual length of my comments today, but there are a number of initiatives, some of which have been in planning for years, some for a few quarters, that are converging at C3 AI, that some of which you will want to understand to fully appreciate the gestalt of the business operations at CI. It is clear that the commentary that we have all been hearing in recent earning announcements about market uncertainty, budget cuts and lengthening sales cycles as the market anticipates economic downturn is real. This was our experience in the last quarter also. Our customers and prospects appear to be expecting a recession, and we are seeing customer purchasing behavior consistent with that expectation. It appears to us that this market downturn could be significant. So we have put into place a combination of measures that will allow us to not simply weather this downturn, but to emerge a stronger, more rapidly growing company with greater market share and greater market presence. The measures that we have implemented include a restructured, more productive enterprise sales function, an enhancement of our strategic partnering model, several new product offerings, a new consumption-based pricing model and an acceleration of our path to profitability. These measures, in aggregate, will allow us to accelerate sales cycles, accelerate product adoption, increase market share, increase revenue growth and increase profitability. I will explain each of these actions in some detail. But first, I will comment on the financial results and significant developments during the first quarter. Our total revenue of $65.3 million grew 25% year-over-year. This was in line with our guidance. I will comment also that this is the seventh consecutive quarter as a public company that we have met or exceeded revenue guidance. Our subscription revenue for the quarter was $57 million, a growth rate of 24% year-over-year. Subscription revenue represented 87% of total revenue. Services revenue was 13%. Total RPO grew 58% year-over-year to $458.2 million. Our current RPO at the end of the quarter was $173.5 million, nearly 20% growth year-over-year. We signed 31 customer contracts in the quarter and had an average total contract value of $1.4 million as it compared to 24 contracts with an average TCV of $1.9 million in the year ago quarter. This represents a 29% increase in contracts compared to the year ago period. We maintained non-GAAP gross profit margins of 81%. Customer growth increased 27% over a year ago and in the quarter with 228 customers. We ended Q1 with $938.2 million in cash and investments. Free cash flow in the quarter was an outflow of $54.8 million. Note please that this included $15 million of CapEx related to the build-out of our new headquarters and $16 million related to a commission payment to Baker Hughes. Since going public in December of 2020, C3 AI has spent $245.9 million on R&D to expand our technology leadership. This investment amounted to 59% of revenue. The bulk of this substantial investment was focused on the development of Version 8 of the C3 AI Platform, a four-year engineering effort, representing over 1,000 person years of development. It provides our customers order of 10x to 1,000x scalability and performance improvements, that of many new data integrations, new no-code, low-code and deep code development tools, improved data science tools; and importantly, dramatically improved ease of use, more comprehensive content sensitive documentation, new integrated development environments, a content-rich distance learning library for remote trading and a 24/7 developer community. The capabilities of C3 AI Version 8 are a carefully planned prerequisite to our important transition to a new consumption-based pricing model that we are announcing today. C3 AI has been broadly recognized in the industry for its functional and architectural leadership as A, if not the premier AI/ML application development platform in the market by Forrester Research, Gartner, Constellation Research, IDC and Bloomberg. In July, Forrester Research named C3 AI, a Leader in The 2022 Forrester Wave for AI and Machine Learning Platforms. This is a first of its kind comprehensive analysis of enterprise AI and machine learning platforms, highlighting the importance of comprehensive AI/ML platforms like C3 AI as opposed to do-it-yourself widgets to realize business value. Of the 15 vendors evaluated, the Forrester report ranks the C3 AI Platform and applications number one in strategy, number one in product vision, number one in application tools, number one in application accelerators, number one in market approach, number one in run time, number one in architecture security, number one in data features, number one in partner ecosystem and number one in performance. The Forrester report concludes that C3 AI could become, and the quote, de facto AI platform standard for the world's most complex industries. Aside from the C3 AI Platform and the enhancement of the new applications that we've developed, you can think of AI-enhanced or predictive ERP, supply chain risk, inventory optimization, process optimization, fraud detection, predictive maintenance and money laundering, et cetera, each with industry-specific versions. Our R&D investments resulted in the release of five new C3 AI applications since our IPO, each with functional capabilities and addressable market opportunities is sufficient to support a stand-alone company. Let's start with C3 AI CRM. This allows customers to make their existing often very expensive CRM investments instantly predicted. We've been piloting the new C3 AI CRM product with a large professional services company and industrial products company and a large fintech company, the initial results are dramatic. According to Gartner, the CRM market should reach $137 billion in 2025, and we believe C3 AI CRM addresses a significant unmet need in that market. Let's talk about C3 AI ESG. This enables customers to integrate data from all their ERP, supplier, customer and manufacturing systems, plus relevant exogenous market data, emissions and commodity data and provide comprehensive Scope 1, Scope 2, Scope 3 ESG reporting in compliance with any of the SaaS GRI TCFD and CDP reporting standards. C3 AI ESG, like all C3 applications, is entirely predictive, allowing companies to accurately forecast their ESG KPIs and plan and manage mitigation measures to achieve their corporate ESG objectives. Consistent with our overall partnering strategy, you can expect us to partner with a large global service provider to bring this product to market. According to [Predantec], ESG is estimated to be a $30 billion digital market by 2030. C3 AI property appraisal. Designed to meet the needs of state, county and local government, C3 AI property appraisal allows real estate appraisers real-time integration of all data sources and the application logic necessary to rapidly complete commercial and residential property appraisals using a multiplicity evaluation technologies, including income capitalization, sales comparables and cost of replacement. Complete evidence packages are provided to defend appraisal protests and adjudication. Initial results suggests this application reduces the time and cost to complete appraisals by an order of magnitude. C3 AI property appraisal addresses the needs of over 3,000 U.S. counties at over 19,000 U.S. cities, villages and towns and 50 states. C3 AI law enforcement. Derived from our C3 AI intelligence application developed for the U.S. federal intelligence community. C3 AI intelligence analytics for law enforcement provides peace officers the ability to apply the power of AI to rapidly investigate crimes. A unified current data image of criminal history, law enforcement records, cell phone tracking, traffic violations, past associations, gang membership, vehicle records, jail records, surveillance images and body camera image footage, body camera footage, social media and news is embedded in intuitive workflow, employing sophisticated AI/ML techniques to surface insights in near real time. Designed to meet the needs of over 15,000 law enforcement agencies in the U.S. alone, according to the market research for our markets and markets, this is expected to be a $22 billion software market in 2026. C3 AI Ex Machina. This is a point and click, drag and drop analytics tool that enables business analysts to rapidly apply sophisticated AI/ML techniques and predictive analytics to large data sets. Ex Machina can be used as a standalone tool, and is fully interoperable with the C3 AI Enterprise applications and the C3 AI Platform. Ex Machina meets the needs of the rapidly growing citizen data science community. Gartner predicts this is a $14 billion addressable market in 2025. Now in response to your request from the investor community to see C3 AI application demos, we have published demos of these and other applications on our website at this address that show of, basically c3.ai/applications. These demonstrations are available to you today. In addition, to provide you even more complete information about these applications and our other applications, we are hosting a C3 AI live demo series, okay, starting in September to provide you more in-depth product demonstrations. Registration for these demonstrations opens next Tuesday, and you can register at our IR site at c3.ai. Talk a little bit about customer success in the quarter. Our customers continue to be highly successful with their C3 AI applications. Shell, for example, continues to expand the global deployment of its AI applications to deliver cleaner, safer, more reliable energy with less environmental impact. At Shell, we integrate over 1.2 million data streams and monitor over 13,000 pieces of critical equipment in near real time. At the U.S. Missile Defense Agency, they submitted its third order against our five-year $500 million production OTA agreement that we were awarded in December of 2021. This agreement makes it easy for everybody in DoD to purchase C3 AI products and services. At the U.S. Air Force Rapid Sustainment office, we continue to expand and scale our efforts to improve aircraft readiness, and now have 14 aircraft platforms live on our software platform, including the F-15, F-16, F-18, F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, C5 Galaxy, KC-135, Blackhawk Helicopter and others. Our results for the B1B bomber demonstrate the capability increase daily mission-ready capability by 22% to 27%. The value of this may be incalculable. For those of you who are interested, go look up to the B1B Bomber on Wikipedia. This is a very cool supersonic aircraft, okay? And basically, you were able to increase the number of aircraft that are available in any given day by order of 25%. This is a big deal. We expect that, as a result of this, we expect to see significant licensing expansion of this program in the coming year, leveraging the $100 million and $500 million ATO contract vehicles that we had been awarded to expand this AI predictive maintenance application across many additional aircraft platforms. Let's talk about our partnering model. We further expanded and deepened our highly productive strategic partnership with Google Cloud in Q1. This is a big deal. Under this enhanced strategic partnership, Google Cloud has substantially increased its commitment to C3 AI over the next three years to co-sell and co-fund over 100 new C3 AI Tier 1 pilot deployments. Talking about Microsoft, joint selling activity with Microsoft was brisk in Q1, with over 16 joint selling agreements. Microsoft also funded C3 AI trials to accelerate new customer acquisition. To date, we have closed over $265 million in contracts with Microsoft. We're seeing a significant uptick, okay, in joint selling interest from AWS that we expect to continue and to grow in fiscal year '23 and beyond. AWS remains our largest installed base with approximately 56% of our customers running on the AWS cloud. Our strategic partnership with Baker Hughes remains strong. In Q1, C3 AI and Baker Hughes, one of the largest petrochemical companies in Latin America, to license the C3 AI Reliability application. In addition, C3 AI is collaborating with Baker Hughes, Microsoft and Accenture to develop and market a comprehensive industrial asset management solution for clients in the energy and industrial sectors. Now let me make some comments on kind of the overall kind of macro market conditions that we saw last quarter. The fact of the matter is that similar to what we've been hearing from other companies, we saw a significant change in the business environment in the quarter with the lengthening of decision cycles, and that was particularly accelerated in July. In the course of the quarter, we saw 66 forecasted deals move out in the quarter, many of which we would have fully expected to close under normal market conditions. While we expect that the bulk of these transactions will close going forward, it is clear that the decision processes are being subjected to more rigorous budgetary scrutiny and additional levels of approval authority. As a result, we have gotten together with the management team, and we have taken decisive action to address what appears to be a significant global market correction to accelerate business, accelerate profitability and strengthen the company. We are substantially reducing spending that does not directly impact revenue to accelerate our already communicated path to profitability, and importantly, to serve our significant cash resources. We have further adjusted our go-to-market model, our partnership model and our pricing model around consumption-based pricing to better meet the needs of our customers and more effectively address the market opportunity in this new economic reality. With $938 million cash and investments in hand, we are well positioned to weather this economic storm. Now we have taken action to accelerate our path to profitability and have restructured our pricing model in a manner consistent with SaaS industry standards to accelerate business velocity, increase revenue visibility, increase revenue growth rate and increase profitability. We will emerge from this recession a stronger and more competitive company. We have reduced marketing expenses and cut virtually all noncritical expenses. We continue to hire, especially in sales and engineering, and our engineering growth is expanding more rapidly in Guadalajara with its significant cost benefits. As we enjoy non-GAAP gross margins in excess of 80%, it is a straightforward proposition to reach non-GAAP profitability and cash positivity from normal business operations. As a percent of revenue, we have taken action to target a reduction in marketing expenditures from 29% to 11%. We're reducing R&D expenses just associated with the scale of what we're doing, okay, from 44% to 29% of revenue. G&A expenses will be reduced from 15% to 12%. We expect sales expenses will increase from 23% to 26% of revenue. While we are not providing guidance to this effect, we currently expect to obtain non-GAAP profitability and positive cash generation from normal operations by the end of fiscal year '24. During the same period, absent any extraordinary events, we do not expect our cash and investment balances to fall below $700 million. Now I want to talk about our sales force. In our Q2 fiscal year '22 call, I talked about reengineering the profile of the sales organization from a traditional SAP, Oracle, enterprise-like sales software organization to more of an emphasis of organization consisted of highly educated, experienced technical domain experts who are engaged in selling. We have succeeded that task. After an extensive interview and screening process, we hired, trained and continue to meter scores of new high-performance technically confident, technical sales professionals and their initial progress and promise is impressive. I want to give you a feel for the composition of this new team that is becoming the fabric and leadership of the new C3 AI sales organization. The average age is 35, all have one or more advanced degrees, 67% have MBAs. On average, they have 12 years of work experience. Many were at or near the top of their classes at West Point, the Naval Academy, MIT, Princeton, Illinois, Michigan, Berkley, Stanford, \u00c9cole Polytechnique, et cetera. They went on to gain technical advanced degrees at the Army War College, MIT, Georgia Tech and Carnegie Mellon. Many continued with MBA from Harvard, Booth, Sloan, MCA, et cetera. They have commanded F-18 squadrons, they have taught in the top gun school, they have worked at [DCT and Bain], [Merritt] and Goldman Sachs, Amazon and SpaceX. We are providing this team with extensive sales training and ongoing sales metering. This program is exceeding our expectations and expect in every respect, and we will continue to expand this new sales force in the coming quarters. I can assure you, this is a force to be reckoned with. Now the C3 AI pricing model, this is important. I want to talk about the switch from subsidiary risk pricing to consumption-based pricing. This is an important -- this is a secular change in our business, okay? We have been planning it for some years, and it is now enabled by the general availability of C3 AI Version 8 in both the platform and the applications. Now the C3 AI pricing model has historically been something of a black swan in the SaaS world. While others, including Snowflake, AWS, Azure, Datadog and Mongo have been selling based on a low-price inventory, pay-as-you-go consumption-based pricing model, C3 AI has historically been an anomaly in the SaaS world with a subscription-based pricing model. Our sales cycles included lengthy negotiation of what were typically 36 month contractual contracts, including developer license fees, application license fees, data science license fees, professional services and run time fees, with the total initial commitment ranging from $1 million to $35 million or more. Now these customer commitments typically expanded over time in $1 million, $5 million or even $50 million increments as our customers achieve success. And we've been able to command these types of customer commitments in the past decade because of the substantial customer value that our products and services generated sometimes on the order of billions of dollars a year in economic benefit. This pricing model has allowed us to attain 228 customers, realize a 38% revenue growth rate in fiscal year '22 and achieved a compound annual growth rate of 40% for revenue from fiscal year '19 through fiscal year '22. The downside has been more lumpiness than we would like to see in bookings, lengthy sale cycles and higher levels of uncertainty associated with individual deal closure in period. While this elephant hunting subscription sales model has served us well in establishing C3 AI as a leader in enterprise AI, it is clear but is not well suited to the deliberate decision and approval processes inherent in the current economic environment. With the completion of C3 AI Version 8, this is the ideal time for us to adopt a consumption-based pricing model, partner model and sales model that will allow our customers a low-cost point of entry and pay-as-you-go expanded usage pricing. Our new consumption pricing model brings us in line with what we believe is becoming the accepted standard in enterprise SaaS application software pricing. The sales motion now begins with a six-month pilot project during which the customer will bring its first C3 AI Enterprise application into production use. After the initial six months, ongoing pricing is simply $0.55 per CPU hour. The cost of entry is low, the business to move forward is easy, the protracted acquisition deliberation process is avoided. While the initial revenue ramp will be slower from each new customer, considering the substantial increase in the number of new customers, we expect to see a substantial increase in revenue and revenue growth rates after three to four quarters. We believe this will be further accelerated by increased effectiveness of our joint partner selling model and especially by our new agreement with Google Cloud to go sell and fund 50% of the cost of over 100 Tier 1 new customer engagements, making it quite easy for new customers to adopt C3 AI applications. Now without providing guidance, okay, for modelling purposes only, we will assume that each onboarded sales rep can close average of four new customer pilots per year, we assume that 70% of pilots will convert into production use, we estimate customer attrition is 10% a year. We believe the new pilot will generate, on average, $80,000 per month for six months, okay, and then initially $70,000 per month in consumption fees, growing at actual usage increases. Assuming that we have an average of 60 sales professionals in Q2 and that sales headcount will grow at 10% per quarter, if you run this model with our eight to 12 quarters, you will find that revenue flatness for three quarters and then rapidly accelerates in fiscal year '24 and beyond to growth rates in the top decile of the SaaS software universe. Our new consumption model aligns well with our partners Baker Hughes, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services and fits perfectly with the hyperscaler marketplaces and their pricing models. Combining the effectiveness of our new sales organization, the consumption-based pricing model, the power of the Google Cloud joint sales and pilot funding program and our other important marketing partnerships, we expect a substantial increase in new customers and associated increase in SaaS revenue growth rate and market share. Like other companies that have transitioned from perpetual licensing to subscription licensing or subscription consumption licensing, including, for example, Adobe, Mongo, New Relic and Elastic. The near-term impact on revenue and RPO will be negative. But after three or four quarters, we expect it to become highly accretive to revenue and RPO. The near-term effect of new customer cap will be quite positive. [Technical difficulty] and our prospects, and we are confident that this will significantly [technical difficulty] function processing ML against actual revenue that we realized from a number of representatives C3 AI customers over the first -- over their initial 10 quarters, and we find it to be license revenue neutral across that customer listed aggregate.  Now, we can see, for example, this -- I thought there were kind of three slides that were going to happen here, but I guess it didn't work that way. Okay. We can see that this is -- okay, so this shows -- the orange line shows our cumulative subscription revenue that we get from 10 actual customers over the first 10 quarters. This amounts to -- initially, it was $60 million in bookings. And when you put the additional bookings that each did over these 10 quarters, I think it's $214 million in bookings, and in aggregate, adds up to $41 million in revenue. Now using this new consumption pricing model, it's basically revenue neutral, except that we didn't have to close -- it's revenue neutral, except basically had to close 10 $0.5 million deals, and after that, it's 55% per CPU hour. So it avoids the -- having to close $60 million in initial deals and then $1 million, $5 million, $10 million, $25 million, $50 million incremental deals to get $210 million in bookings. And people, in this market environment, I'm telling you closing a $50 million deal with any multibillion-dollar corporation, it has to go to the Board, okay? So you could play in this game in the last decade, we played it very well, but that game is over, okay? So now we have a pricing model that we think meets the market needs quite well, okay? So basically, we get the same level of revenue, we're closing 10 deals for $0.5 million, and we have to keep the customers happy, okay? Bottom line, we are running a leaner company with a faster path of profitability. We are conserving cash. We got lucky, okay, really, and that the availability of Version 8 happen to coincide with the market downturn, enabling us to shift to this consumption-based pricing and partnering model really at an opportune time. Growth, as we can see, growth is slower, this is the blue line -- the orange line shows basically where your analyst projections were for the company growth kind of in the next 12 quarters, okay? And we're going to see the blue line is the shift to consumption-based revenue. Revenue flattens out in the short term because we're doing $0.5 million deals instead of $50 million deals, okay? But then as the number of customers increases, about three or four quarters out, we cross to a dramatically accelerated revenue growth rate. And so we expect to see growth will be fall for the next few quarters, and then we expect to see rapid revenue growth, increased customer count and increased profitability in fiscal year '24 and beyond, okay? When this economic turmoil has subsided, C3 AI will emerge stronger, bigger, more profitable with greater market share. Turning to guidance. As mentioned, we expect a short-term negative impact on our revenue growth as a result of the new consumption model, and our guidance takes that into consideration. The model suggests that we -- the model also suggests -- when you run the model -- if you run the model, you're getting the right with the assumption that we have provided, okay? You see that the ball anticipates a dramatic acceleration of revenue growth and profitability in fiscal '24 and beyond. As such, our Q2 total revenue is expected to be in the range of $60 million to $62 million. Our total fiscal year '23 revenue is expected to be in the range of $255 million to $270 million. For fiscal year '24 and beyond, we expect revenue growth will revert to historical annual growth rates -- to be more in line with our historical annual growth rate, and actually, we expect them to be significantly in excess of 30%. Now I'll turn the call over to my colleague, Juho, to talk -- to provide more color on the financial results of the quarter. Juho?\nJuho Parkkinen : Thank you, Tom. I want to provide a brief recap of our financial results. All figures will be discussed on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. As Tom mentioned, we ended the quarter with revenue of $65.3 million, which represents a 25% year-over-year growth. Subscription revenue increased by a solid 24%, contributing 87% of total revenue. Gross profit increased 29% to $52.6 million, and gross margin increased 260 basis points to 80.6%. Operating loss improved $7.3 million year-over-year, while operating loss margin improved from negative 42% to negative 22%. Our customer count increased by 27% year-over-year to 228, and we closed 31 deals during the quarter. This reflects a nice increase in our band of less than 1 million deals, which grew at 44% year-over-year. We made progress on our path towards lower average total contract value, or TCV, with an average TCV of $1.4 million in the first quarter, down from $2.9 million in the sequential fourth quarter. This gives us further conviction that transitioning to smaller contract sizes and expanding our go-to-market strategy to include smaller deal values is the right way to engage new customers. Now turning to our RPOs and bookings. We reported non-GAAP remaining performance obligations of $496.8 million, which is up 39% from last year. We were especially happy to see further diversity in our bookings by industry. Hi-tech increased to 46% of bookings. Turning to cash flow. Free cash flow for the quarter was an outflow of $54.8 million, about $15 million was used for the build-out of our new headquarters. In addition, we had a commission payment to Baker Hughes of $16 million. Normalizing for these two payments, our adjusted free cash flow was an outflow of $23.8 million. As a reminder, this will not be a meaningful factor impacting our path to profitability because the impact will be amortized over the term of the lease. Regarding our transition to a consumption pricing model, we have provided a set of assumptions that are intended to assist you in modeling the future potential revenue for the company. Please refer to the attachment that is downloadable on our website after the call. We're keenly focused on executing against our path to profitability as the creator of the enterprise AI space. We have made significant investments in branding and marketing from the start. As we have now successfully built a strong brand in the marketplace, we're comfortable reducing our investments there. We have always been focused on delivering long-term sustainable profitable growth for our shareholders, and we're pleased to be able to accelerate our path to profitability with our transition to a consumption-based model. With these remarks, I would like to open this up for questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Pat Walravens from JMP Securities.\nPatrick Walravens : So if you look at fiscal '23, you took revenue down $50 million at the midpoint. How much of that is because of the consumption model and how much of it is because the business is slower?\nTom Siebel : Good question, Pat. First of all, there is no question that business is slowing out in the market. But it doesn't matter if we made this change at any growth rate, okay, revenue would have flat, just like when -- as companies switch from professional licensing models to subscription model. So the growth rate is absolutely -- the change in growth rate is absolutely driven by the change in pricing models. Instead of doing $5 million, $10 million, $25 million, $50 million transactions, a few of them were out doing a lot of $0.5 million transactions, okay? But when you run the model, there is no way this does not flatten revenue for a few quarters.\nPatrick Walravens : Juho, do you have anything to add?\nJuho Parkkinen : No, I think Tom summarized it perfectly.\nPatrick Walravens : Okay. So I mean, let's say you stuck with the old model, what would guidance have been like?\nTom Siebel: Honestly, I think trying to sell $10 million, $20 million, $30 million, $50 million, $60 million transactions in the next year could be pretty tough, Pat. I mean, large chemical companies, manufacturing companies, food companies, I mean these guys are all going to the bunkers, okay? They're preparing for a recession.\nPatrick Walravens : Okay. And what drove RPO? I mean, RPO is actually, I think, we were looking for 420, it was 458. What drew that? Or what drove that?\nJuho Parkkinen : I mean, we still had pretty good -- we still had lots of deal activity during the quarter, and that's a natural increase on the total RPO every time we do one of those bookings. But I think, Pat, one of the things that we're very excited about is the current RPO increase sequentially. So that further highlights...\nTom Siebel : What drove is basically 66 deals out of the quarter, okay? That's why RPO is less of a number that we've got. I mean, if you close them, it'd be in our...\nJuho Parkkinen : Yes, on the non-GAAP RPO, yes.\nTom Siebel: Non-GAAP RPO.\nJuho Parkkinen : Yes. Yes, he's right on that.\nPatrick Walravens : So I'm just wondering, was there something big with Google or something that had a 10-year term or something like that that helped drive that number?\nJuho Parkkinen : No. I mean, we had normal business activities.\nTom Siebel: Juho, go back and show the deal. I think it's really -- there's no big -- just go back show the -- there it is at.\nJuho Parkkinen : So most of what you see here, Pat, we have lots of activity in the $1 million range, which we're very excited about, and we only had one larger view in the quarter in excess of $7 million.\nPatrick Walravens : Okay. And then last question. So are there any layoffs as part of the cost reductions?\nTom Siebel: No.\nJuho Parkkinen : No.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Sanjit Singh from Morgan Stanley.\nJian Huang : This is Jian for Sanjit. So I wanted to dig a little bit into the shift to consumption pricing and especially sort of on the installed base side. So I mean, you talked a lot about kind of the new customers. But I was wondering about the adoption with existing customers and sort of what you're expecting over what period of time the installed base would transition to a consumption model. And especially for long-term contracts, could we see those transitions during contract terms or just upon renewal? And then maybe a second one for Juho. So what really are the metrics to track here going forward to understand how demand is or how the business is executing among the shift to consumption pricing? If you could maybe shed some light into sort of what KPIs become more or less relevant as we're moving to the consumption model, that would be great.\nTom Siebel: Regarding -- let me handle the existing contracts. I think that the existing contracts will not be shifting to this model. And most of these contracts are so big now -- some of them are now in aggregate over $100 million. And when you look at all the collections in terms of conditions that they have, they're actually more favorable than this pricing model, okay? And so I don't think they're going to want to switch to this. As they renew, when they come up for renewal, they can switch to this if they want to work this out at the time. Juho, you want to talk about KPIs, certainly, new customers is going to be an important one.\nJuho Parkkinen : Yes, absolutely. So thank you, Jian, for the question. I think one of the things that should give you a lot of guidance on this is that you look at our slide deck and we listed some of the assumptions. Those would be good things to track, but certainly new customers and then revenue because, of course, consumption itself will be recorded as revenue for those periods. So that will be one of the most important KPIs that we'll be providing in the future, of course.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Pinjalim Bora from JPMorgan.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Rachit on for Pinjalim. Can you update us on what you are seeing with respect to Ex Machina? And is that resonating with the customers?\nTom Siebel: I'm not sure what Ex Machina data that we have. We did a couple of large -- we did one large agreement with Ex Machina. It\u2019s -- I just don't have this data before. Do you have data for Ex Machina?\nJuho Parkkinen : No, no specifics like that. I think the one deal that large during the quarter was a more important one. So the large insurance company that licensed it.  Let us do this. So let's prepare some detailed information and follow up on this. We just don't have it here. We will follow that with you and we'll get you all the details.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Got it. And then Q3 is your largest federal quarter considering alliance with your fiscal year end? Are you seeing the pipeline build on that? And is there any sign of slowdown on the federal side that you are noticing?\nTom Siebel: You're really breaking up. I think, how do we see the pipeline. Okay. The pipeline is longer than it's ever been. I can tell you that was one of the partners were discussed, we're currently, I think, this number is right, okay, that we're currently in active discussion on 100 co-sell opportunities, okay, with one of the currently -- 100, that's just with one partner. So the pipeline now gets dramatically longer, the number of new customers we expect to increase pretty dramatically. And the pipeline is very long. That being said, in the -- as we get into the fall of 2022 with war, famine, inflation and all the weird stuff that's going on, if you have a $10 million, $20 million, $30 million, $40 million or $50 million deal in the pipeline, it's hard to handicap it. It really is. So that's why we're -- we've been anticipating in doing this for some years. And now with Version 8, we're ready. And so we're pulling the trigger and we're going.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brad Sills from Bank of America.\nBradley Sills : I wanted to ask about some just color on some of those 66 deals that pushed out -- what are your thoughts on -- I know there are a lot of moving parts of the macro right now, pricing changes, partner model changes, but any visibility as to timing there, when those might close?\nTom Siebel: Well, many of them -- it's really a question, Brad. So we're now coming back to them with -- we'd basically have the new pricing model, okay? And it is being very well received. So we think they're very real. We think they're a lot easier to close at $0.5 million than they would have been at $5 million or $10 million. And so that provides a tailwind for our business. And the pricing model, and they've got a number of aspects to it that are really being well-received. We used a price per developer. We used to provide per data scientists. Now it's unlimited developers, unlimited data scientists. For the first six months, it's unlimited run time. And so we've kind of taken out all the obstacles that were there. And if you get somebody to sign up for $0.5 million pilot for six months, it's not difficult, okay? And then the decision to go forward, you keep it, you pay 35% per CPU hour, doesn't need to go to the Board, doesn't need to go to the audit committee, doesn't need to go to the CFO, any person in the line of business can sign it. So I think that looks very promising.\nBradley Sills : Got it. And then one more, if I may, please, on just the GAAP RPO, maybe this is one for you, Juho, did decline 4% this quarter from last quarter. Was that related to this change to consumption pricing from subscription. Anything you can do to help us unpack just the GAAP number quarter-on-quarter?\nJuho Parkkinen : Well, I think that's kind of on Tom's opening remarks that it was a tough quarter. And then also the fact that we had the 66 deals that were pushed out in the quarter that definitely impacted the sequential decline in -- that's the primary driver.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Vidovic from KeyBanc.\nMichael Vidovic : On the Baker Hughes relationship, did you meet targets in the quarter? And have there been any changes to the longer-term targets with that?\nTom Siebel: Did we meet targets in the quarter? I think we did. Yes, I think we did, Michael, and the relationship with Baker Hughes remains intimate. I mean, I -- and we're in discussion about any number of interesting things, one of which is the relationship that we discussed with Microsoft or Baker Hughes and C3 to build a kind of very robust industrial asset management products. So I think we announced that a couple of quarters ago, and that's -- I was just down in Houston working out the details of that. So Baker Hughes is going well.\nBradley Sills : Okay. Great. And then just last one for me. Last quarter, you talked about deals being pushed out into fiscal 1Q and fiscal but you set at the time that they were not being retired. Did that play out as you expected? And then were most of those closed this quarter? Or do you see further pushouts?\nTom Siebel: No, I mean it was -- guys, it was a tough quarter out there. I mean we saw a lot of deals move sideways. All of a sudden, those people who have approval authority to sign deals in previous quarters, all of a sudden, they didn't have the approval authority to sign deals. And so right now, doing a large multimillion dollar or tens of millions of dollars capital contracts and corporations in any industry in the world is tough. And everything that we're hearing about in every conference call on CNB or every report on CNBC in the morning, it's true guys. People are getting ready for -- they're going into a recession footing. And so we think that what we're doing here is quite timely, and it's going to allow us to power through it. Again, we have almost $1 billion of cash in the bank. I think we are well prepared for this.\nOperator: Our next and final question comes from the line of Gal Munda from Wolfe Research.\nGal Munda : The first one is just around the new model. Is there -- is it fair to assume that all new contracts, all new deals are going right away into the consumption model? Or would you still kind of allow for exceptions for if there was something already in the pipeline for it?\nJuho Parkkinen : Great question. Number one, yes, there are a few contracts that we're closing that -- where the paper is already on the table, and we're just -- everybody is happy to move forward. Secondly, you can anticipate that we will -- like we have done kind of very large transactions in the past with companies like Baker Hughes, NG, Shell, where somebody will want to go all in, in a big way. And we're reasonable people, and we will sit down with them, and we will get negotiate a win-win arrangement that will be based upon some other terms that this consumption-based pricing model. And so no, you won't see -- we'll still see the occasional black swan that comes in here that looks like an [indiscernible] and wants to do business in a big way. And we're reasonable people, and we'll find a way to do that.\nGal Munda : That makes sense. And then just as a follow-up, you mentioned that within the quarter, there was actually quite a bit of activity. It sounded like maybe from a linearity perspective that maybe towards the end of the quarter you saw a lot more kind of issues with closing the deals and some of that hesitance. Is that a fair assessment of the quarter the way that you've seen it? Or was it just the whole quarter was very, very hard?\nTom Siebel: No. I'll be honest with you, we're -- so July was embracing wind. I mean, it really was. I was a bracing headwind in July. And something changed. And something significant change in July in the world. And I mean, there were a number of transactions everybody that I would have bet my life on, okay, with people who I know, with whom we've done business before. And many of them existing -- some existing customers, some not. And I mean, and they move sideways. And so something happened in July out there that was significant. That's definitely not specific to us. This is a macroeconomic phenomenon that affects -- is going to affect everybody.\nEnd of Q&A:\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And this does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program as well as today's program.

Tom?\nTom Siebel: Thank you, Paul and good afternoon everyone. Thank you for joining us. I am pleased to \u2013 I am here with Juho Parkkinen, our Chief Financial Officer. And I am pleased to share with you our results for the fourth quarter and for the entire fiscal year of 2022. Bottom line, it was a great quarter. We finished the quarter with $72.3 million in revenue, up 38% year-over-year, exceeding our guidance and exceeding, I believe, all analysts\u2019 expectations. And I haven\u2019t really looked at lately at the matrix of high-growth software companies, but I expect that would be in the top decile of growth rates. Subscription revenue was $56.3 million, up 31% year-over-year. Our non-GAAP gross profit was $58.5 million, a 43% improvement over the previous year. We ended Q4 of fiscal year \u201822 with GAAP RPO of $477.4 million, a 62% increase year-over-year. Non-GAAP RPO is $516 million, a 50% increase year-over-year. We continue to sustain healthy non-GAAP gross margins of 81%. Our free cash flow for the quarter was a negative $14.8 million, a 46% improvement year-over-year. We finished the quarter with $992 million in cash and cash equivalents. So, we have roughly $1 billion at the bank \u2013 in the bank. And at this rate, it will take quite a few quarters to deplete our cash reserves. Looking at the results for the year, they were quite good, exceeding our guidance and exceeding analyst expectations, finishing the year at $252.7 million in revenue, a 30% growth rate over the previous year. Subscription revenue was $206.9 million, a 31% increase year-over-year and our non-GAAP gross margin increased a little over 5 points to $81.7 million. Now, I want to talk a little bit about the addressable market opportunity, which is really quite staggering. Enterprise AI software is predicted to be almost a $600 billion market by 2025. We spent the better part of the decade building what we call, actually more than a decade now, building what we call the C3.ai Suite. That is a software platform that provides all of the services necessary and sufficient to design, develop, provision, operate even in the most complex enterprise applications. And on top of that, we have to develop and deliver to the market now 42 enterprise AI applications that meet the needs of manufacturing, utilities, oil and gas, chemicals, aerospace, state and local government and other industries. Now, enterprise AI is a very complex market and it has a lot of players who do a lot of things and it is confusing to investors, it is confusing to customers, and it is confusing to the market at large. Because we have all of these kinds of bright shiny objects out there that are provided by hyperscalers and are available as open \u2013 some are available as open source solutions. And they do things like provide machine learning libraries or virtualization or data persistence or machine learning pipelines or whatever it maybe. And many of these are great products. Many of these are great companies. But again, this is really very confusing to investors, to customers and in the market acquired. And C3.ai is frequently lumped into this category. So, I want to take a minute and talk about how we fit into enterprise AI, because it\u2019s quite different from all this and it\u2019s quite different from the way that these companies fit into the market. These organizations generally make piecemeal components that do interesting things like platform independent data persistence, AutoML or whatever. Now the way that we think about enterprise AI applications is the way the market has thought about enterprise application software for the last few decades, where we first began developing enterprise application software in the early \u201880s at companies like Oracle and SAP and later PeopleSoft and Siebel Systems and others, we basically built these applications on top of relational database systems. And on top of relational databases, we built a set of development tools, we are building in reports and forms and whatnot. And we use those to build families of applications that solve business problems like CRM and ERP and manufacturing automation, supply chain management what has. A few decades later, this has grown to be roughly a $500 billion software market and everybody understands it. And these applications are used to solve very real world business problems. They enable companies, for example, to report their inventory balances and their supply chain. A supply chain say for at Boeing for a Boeing 777 might be a million components in a supply chain that stretches from South Carolina to Shenzhen and consists of resistors and transformers and flat actuators and propulsion devices and flight management systems. And they want to be able to report every 30 days or 90 days or 365 days exactly what was the inventory of each item. And by the time you add the Boeing 777 to the 787 for the 767 to 757 and the Boeing 737 or the Boeing 707, there is pretty big parts inventory that you need to be able to report accurately. Or you might be able to \u2013 you might want to report on what your customer churn was 60 days ago or 90 days ago. Okay, if you are a bank, you might have to report on how much fraud took place, how much anti-money laundering took place 90 days ago or 180 days ago. And if you don\u2019t do this correctly, as CEO, you get to rewrite your resume, you get to pay billions of dollars in fine and you might go to jail. So it\u2019s really quite important to get this right. You might want to report on what your customer churn rates were, for example, at rise. And so, this enterprise software is the end market and you know of pretty well as ERP and CRM and supply chain management and what have you. I was there when we started it. And today, it\u2019s roughly $0.5 trillion business. Now, these applications are inherently descriptive in nature. They provide a company a perfect 2020 hindsight into what happened 3 months ago, 6 months ago, a year ago. Now at C3.ai, we spent a decade in almost $1 billion building a software technology stack that consists of a platform as a service, an application development platform and low-code development tools and now including 42 turnkey enterprise applications. And these with C3.ai, we make these existing enterprise applications predictive in nature. Okay. So, now instead of using a database or relationary database for data storage we are using the cloud. Okay, we are using existing ERP systems and CRM systems, like SAP and Salesforce and Oracle and what have you. And we built an AI application layer that makes these applications predictive in nature so they can tell us what\u2019s going to happen in the future so that we can change the future. So rather than simply telling us how many parts we had in each inventory been historically, a predictive AI application will tell us exactly how many parts we need in each bin, in each of the next 180 days to meet the demand function, okay? Rather than tell us how many customers left us 90 days ago or 180 days ago, these applications will now tell us which customers by name are going to leave us in the next 180 days, so we can take action to retain them. Rather than tell us, for example, a number of fraudulent events that we had some time ago, it will identify fraudulent events in real time so we can progress the fraud from happening. The beauty of enterprise AI is when we apply AI to the market of enterprise applications they become predictive in nature that we can predict the future and change the future. Now, this promises to be order of a $600 billion market, not too many years down the road. I believe that if we look 2, 3, 4, 5 years out, this is a complete replacement market for everything that happened in enterprise application software in the last three decades. I do not believe that in 2 years or 3 years or 4 years, companies are going to be satisfied knowing what their customer churn was 90 days ago. They are going to demand to know which customers are going to leave if we don\u2019t take action. Rather than know what our non-deployment rate was for tractors, aircraft, automobiles, they are going to want to have predictive maintenance applications that tell them which machines are going to fail in advance so they can fix the devices before they fail and have lower failure rates. That\u2019s the big deal. That\u2019s what enterprise AI is all about. Now, when we look at the companies that many people in the market, investors and customers, okay, consider to be competitors of AI, okay, really, none of these are competitors. They are all in fact parts. Now, like C3.ai provides out of the box, okay, all of the services necessary to design, develop, provision and operate an AI application. Many of our customers, in fact, all of our customers will have some experience working with AI tools and they want to use many of these third-party products like Databricks for data virtualization or Snowflake for platform independent data persistence or Amazon SageMaker for citizen data scientists or what our Python to develop machine learning tools and C3.ai provides orchestration layer that enables customers to easily meet these solutions together into a cohesive solution. And all of these applications, both open source and proprietary are entirely compatible with the C3.ai platform. So we need to think of all of these things, Alteryx, TensorFlow, AWS, Google Cloud, Databricks, these look more to us like partners than the selection competitors. Let\u2019s take a look at \u2013 this will be an example of the Shell AI platform. We are on top of Azure, they put C3.ai and because they have investments of value in things like Kubernetes for containerization and Databricks for virtualization and TensorFlow for machine learning libraries, Matlab, TIBCO, Alteryx, what have you, we enable them to very easily incorporate these into the C3.ai platform market. This is Shell AI, but virtually 100% of our customers, 100% are using some combination of these other products with the C3.ai platform. So, it\u2019s really quite different than I think what it is perceived to be. Bottom line, all of these independent products appear to us \u2013 that appear to some to be competitors are, in fact, partners. They are partners at Shell, at Koch Industries, at the United States Air Force, at virtually every C3.ai customer. I want to address the issue of customer capture. Our customer count has been growing quite substantially in recent years. And in the last year alone, it grew from 151 customers to 223 customers. But \u2013 and if you look at our diversification by industry, it\u2019s really becoming increasingly diverse like oil and gas, which is a pretty good market to be in today with oil in excess of a rough order of $100 a barrel, pretty good business. At the same time, we have seen a lot of diversification outside of oil and gas. And this is a diversification of the industry, including oil and gas. This is bookings without oil and gas. And you can see that while our \u2013 year-over-year, our bookings in oil and gas grew 95%. Outside of oil and gas, it grew by 116%. So, let\u2019s talk about customer penetration. We are very certainly focused on landing new customers. That being said, when you think about many of our large global customers like Shell, Koch Industries, United States Air Force, Department of Defense, ENGIE, we are very much focused on penetrating these customers deeply. And if we look at this customer base that we have today, it might be 5% to 10% penetrated. Now with many companies in the AI space or the SaaS software space, investors are really interested how many new logos did the vendor add in the quarter and perhaps $10,000 or $20,000 each. That\u2019s not the business we are in, okay. We are in the business of landing very large customers, okay, investing in those customers and making them very large and very successful over a period of years. Let me give you a couple of examples, okay. Shell is, I think, the fifth largest company in the world, one of the largest hydrocarbon producers in the world. Shell has standardized on C3.ai across all lines of business: upstream, downstream, midstream, integration of renewables. Today, they have over 10,000 pieces of equipment monitored by our platform. They have 23 assets in production. Now, I understand the asset at Shell isn\u2019t a pump or a valve. An asset at Shell is something like Pernis, Pernis being the largest refinery in Europe, but I think processes order of 0.5 billion barrels of oil a day. An asset for Shell would be like Nigeria LN gas, okay. So an asset at Shell might be larger than 50% of the companies in the world. Okay. There on the road today that 65 assets in production this year. At our users\u2019 group in March, Shell sit up on stage and they realized \u2013 that they realized in front of all of our customers at our users\u2019 group conference and then they realized a $1 billion of economic benefit from their C3 investments last year and they expect to realize $2 billion of economic benefit from our investors this year. Now I ask you, how many customers are you aware of from SAP, Salesforce, Siebel Systems, Oracle Corporation, whatever it might be, all five companies, how many customers are you aware of who have stood up on stage and said that they are getting $1 billion, $2 billion, $3 billion, $4 billion or $5 billion a year in economic benefit from that solution. I would argue that none of you have ever heard that, because it\u2019s never been said. Let\u2019s take a look at the United States Air Force Rapid Sustainment Office. Again, this is predictive maintenance for aircraft and the Air Force has roughly 5,000 aircraft. Here, we are doing AI-based predictive maintenance for B1 bomber, F-15, F-16, F-18, F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. And look at the speed, this project line shows the speed at which we bring these applications into production. So, what is this all about? This is about integrating all of the data about missions, about weather, about fuel or kilometry from the devices on the aircraft maintenance systems to build predictive models that will predict what device is going to fail, 50 or 100 flight hours before it fails, so that we can avoid the failure. And some of these aircraft cost $100 million a copy and their current availability rate is say 50%. With C3.ai, we can increase the availability by 10%, 20%, 30% and now we deal with the scale of the United States Air Force. This is worth billions of dollars in economic benefit annually. I believe we have 16 aircraft platforms live today and we expect to have 22 platforms live by midyear. So, deeply penetrating these accounts is what C3 is all about. We continue to be focused, okay, on adding new customers. But at C3.ai, it\u2019s more important to look at the lifetime value of our customers than at how many new customers we are sizing. And yes, our customer base is growing with new customers in the quarter, we included PwC, EY, the County of San Mateo. Cargill is a recent customer. Again, what\u2019s really more important okay is the penetration of these customers. Koch Industries, which is more than a $100 billion business, and they became a customer a couple of years ago, made a decision in the quarter to standardize on C3 across all lines of business. This would include Foothills Resources, Georgia-Pacific, Molex, all Koch business units are standardizing on C3. Similarly, at Cargill, we are doing predictive supply chain optimization and supply network risk from one of the largest food producers in the world. And the value of this is quite significant. We are helping feed the world at a time when much of the world is facing famine. So this is what it means to \u2013 for bookings at C3. So this is an example of a large integrated energy company in Europe. Their initial contract was for about \u20ac300,000 in over 8 years. It has continued to grow to \u20ac120 million. This is an example of a large chemical company in the United States, where their initial contract was for $9 million and then it grew to $14 million and then $59 million. This company stood up at Stage Users Group and that they expect to realize $8 billion of economic benefit from C3 this year, $1 billion. This is a major U.S. government agency and how \u2013 now we have penetrated that. This is a large industrial manufacturing company, what have you. So while we might start small, we might start with a trial \u2013 a free trial, a $50,000 trial, a $500 product, a $0.5 million trial or initial project for a couple of million dollars, our goal is to realize sometimes $1 billion, $2 billion, $3 billion, $4 billion in annual economic benefit for the customer. So as you can see, this is quite a different story from what you\u2019re used to seeing in enterprise application software where people are selling hundreds of things for $40,000 a piece. So our primary focus is penetrating existing customers. This is an example of the utility in Europe that today is generating billions of dollars of smart an annual benefit from smart grid analytics. Now the growth strategy, I\u2019ve covered this, all familiar with how we are growing the business. We continue to grow geographically in North America, in Europe, in Asia-Pacific. At the same time, we are building vertical market, sales organizations in financial services, manufacturing, what have you. We are aligning with go-to-market partners in each vertical, bigger use in oil and gas, IS in financial services, [indiscernible] in aerospace and defense. And then we have very meaningful horizontal market partnerships with hyperscalers, very significant relationship with Microsoft, significant and growing relationship with Google, HPE, NVIDIA, okay and others. And so this is what \u2013 this is how we\u2019re expanding all assets of the cube to establish a leadership position. And we\u2019ve made a big investment in this over the years. I\u2019ve talked about it. I\u2019ve talked to you about this. And so how does this investment pay off with these partners, the hyperscalers, vertical market partners, utility partners, oil and gas partners, it\u2019s paid off pretty well. If we look at our bookings for last year, 64% of our bookings, okay, was generated in partnership with these market partners. So this is becoming really quite significant. We have a substantial and growing partner ecosystem. We have a recognized market leadership. We have a proven track record of success. We have a veteran management team. We have a very high-performance culture. We have excellence in execution. Big picture, C3.ai is $0.25 billion software business growing at roughly a 40% compound annual growth rate. We have roughly $1 billion of cash in the bank. And our strategy is quite simply to establish and maintain a market leadership position globally in enterprise AI. Okay. Let\u2019s talk about guidance, okay? Okay. As I mentioned, the addressable market opportunity is large and expand. Our pipeline continues to expand. Our customer footprint is growing. Our balance sheet is rock solid. Okay? I have never been more optimistic about C3.ai than I am today. We have exceeded revenue guidance for each of the six consecutive quarters that we have been a public company and we are tracking exactly to the long-term plan that we laid out during the IPO roadshow, looking to go [indiscernible] it\u2019s still on the web, okay and we\u2019re tracking exactly to what we said that. Our revenue growth rate was 38% in the year ending April, okay, up 17% \u2013 up from 17% in the prior year. Now in the past few years, as you know, okay, we\u2019ve been making substantial investments in branding and advertising. These investments have contributed substantially to our brand equity and market recognition. I\u2019m confident these were prudent and productive investments, we largely created and not only the market category of enterprise AI. That being said, it\u2019s not lost on us that there\u2019s been a fundamental shift in capital market expectations regarding cash flow. Until recently, the market rewarded rapid growth at any cost. This has clearly changed the market currently demanding sustainable growth combined with free cash flow, with free cash flow. We are confident that we can achieve that goal. Our economic model is quite healthy. This is a structurally profitable business with a strong cash balance and a non-GAAP gross margin of 80%. Our investments in branding and advertising over the last few years have been very effective in establishing C3.ai as a market leader in enterprise AI. And those investments will now permit us to dramatically reduce our branding investments as a percent of revenue going forward. We\u2019ll benefit from cost economies of scale, in product marketing and development, and we will realize additional savings from expanding the bulk of our engineering and services capacity in our new Guadalajara, Mexico facility. To drive growth, we will continue to expand our investments in sales, partner capacity and service capacity commensurate with revenue growth. Our target is to generate sustainable positive free cash flow within eight to 12 quarters. Under stable market conditions, I would guide to a 30% or greater growth rate for fiscal year 2023. With the current economic and political uncertainty, however, and pervasive market passivism, we are inclined to set the expectations by low. While we are much more optimistic about the business, we\u2019re not sure the guiding high is at any benefit to our shareholders. Also, candidly, we did see some business that we expected to close in Q4 got moved out of the quarter. And we feel there is still too much lumpiness in our pipeline. Taking all of this into consideration, we believe it is prudent to provide fiscal year \u201823 Q1 revenue guidance of $65 million to $67 million. And fiscal year \u201823 growth targets of 23% to 25%. By the way, there is a typo on the slide that the vendor was not able to pick up. It\u2019s so \u2013 it says \u201822 and in fact, this is a \u201823. So I apologize for that error. When market conditions stabilize, we expect to target 35 \u2013 30% to 35% steady-state top line growth, while continuing to grow free cash flow to 20% non-GAAP targets. Now well, free cash flow, it\u2019s just a 20% target. That\u2019s the predict non-GAAP, okay? Now I\u2019m going to turn the call over to our experienced and accomplished Chief Financial Officer, Juho Parkkinen, to provide additional color on our business results and plans, and then we will throw this open to questions. Juho, over to you.\nJuho Parkkinen: Thank you, Tom. First off, I want to quickly recap on the summary financial results. As Tom mentioned, we ended the quarter with revenue of $72.3 million or 38% growth. Subscription revenue increased by a healthy 31% year-over-year growth. I would also like to highlight the remaining performance obligations of $477.4 million, a 62% year-over-year increase. Further, during the quarter, we repurchased approximately 720,000 shares for $15 million under our share repurchase program announced in Q3. With respect to the full year, we are roughly $0.25 billion business, as Tom mentioned, with a 38% year-over-year increase and we\u2019ve been able to maintain really 5 excellent gross margin rates of 79% for the year, which is a 3-point increase from the prior year. Here are the trends from the past year, indicating again a nice healthy growth on a year-over-year basis. And moving on to the deal bans, we were quite happy to see a 35% sequential increase in deals to close 27 deals during the quarter. We saw a nice increase with respect to our pound of less than $1 million deals, where we do a lot of transactions in trials to customers. And then in the higher band, we saw application and platform deals, whether it was with new customers directly into enterprise deals, or renewals or expansions with existing customers. Overall, our path towards a lower average TCV continues to improve, where in Q3, we were at $5.6 million and now in Q4, our average TCV was $2.9 million. With respect to the revenue mix, subscription revenue was 78% of Q4 revenue and professional services was at 22%. When we think about the sizes of the deals we make with some of the most known entities on the planet, it\u2019s not rational for us not to really invest in these customers with professional services. We generally see expansions in subscription as a result of successful pro serving patients. We were able to improve our gross margins and our non-GAAP operating margin during the period as well. Path to profitability. We spent some time this quarter thinking about the long-term prospects and the long-term path to a sustained operating profit on a non-GAAP basis. We\u2019ve broken out for everybody\u2019s benefit, sales and marketing into separate marketing and sales lines. In addition, you see the traditional research and development and G&A as well as cost of revenue. The key takeaway is that we currently operate at a negative 29% non-GAAP operating margin. We are confident that we have a robust, executable plan to get to an operating profit position sometime in FY \u201824 to FY \u201825 range. We believe that we are structurally profitable and are able to maintain our growth \u2013 are able to maintain our gross margin on a prospective basis. As we had indicated during the IPO, we have invested heavily in brand recognition, which we believe has been very successful. We believe that we have reached the point where from here, we can sustain our brand with lower investments. With respect to our sales team, we will continue to invest in additional capacity on a global level. With respect to research and development, we are very pleased with our start with our Guadalajara application development center professionals and expect strong growth in that team. The natural benefits from economies of scale, combined with the lower human capital costs will drive R&D spend lower as a proportion of total revenue. Finally, for G&A related costs, we expect economies of scale to reduce the proportional spend in this category. Overall, we\u2019re excited about our Q4 results and are looking forward for the upcoming fiscal year. And with that, it\u2019s time to hear the questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Arvind Ramnani with Piper Sandler. Please proceed.\nArvind Ramnani: Hi, thanks for taking my question. Just really want to ask about guidance. On the last earnings call, although you didn\u2019t provide formal guidance, you had talked about being comfortable with consensus, which was about 33% growth. And then when I look at this year\u2019s number, kind of growth is closer to like mid-20%. If you can just kind of talk about the change in environment that\u2019s caused kind of the revision of guidance or is it \u2013 do I look at your guidance as sort of more \u2013 sort of conservative and this is a starting point for the year?\nTom Siebel: Well. Hi, Arvind, it\u2019s Tom. Thanks for the question. I haven\u2019t seen a lot of enthusiasm and sheer, okay, in any market activity in the last 2 months since our last call. I would say that what we\u2019re seeing from the market is really quite dire. If you look at \u2013 candidly, so I think that given everything that is going on in the market, okay, it seemed prudent to us to set market expectations at conservatively, and that\u2019s what we did.\nArvind Ramnani: Perfect. That\u2019s great. And just in terms of kind of bookings growth still seems sort of healthy, if you can kind of double it and give us kind of a little bit granularity where you\u2019re seeing kind of bookings growth from like the particular industries or clients that you\u2019re seeing strong growth from in terms of bookings?\nTom Siebel: Yes. Well, if we look at \u2013 let\u2019s see where is Q4? Let\u2019s see, 42% of our bookings were in manufacturing, 18% in financial services, 15% in defense and aerospace, 13% in oil and gas, 4% in accounting services, and then it goes into agriculture, food processing, retail hospitals. But it\u2019s becoming efficiently diversified.\nArvind Ramnani: Perfect. That\u2019s very helpful. I will go back in queue for further questions.\nTom Siebel: And as I mentioned, for the year, I think booking growth in oil and gas, which is a big business for us and a good business, was 95%. And outside of gold gas, I think it was 115%. So, the diversification strategy is playing out well.\nArvind Ramnani: Yes, yes. I would agree with that.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from Patrick Walravens with JMP Securities.\nPatrick Walravens: Great. Thank you. Hey, Tom, can we start by hearing a little bit more about the deals that slipped in Q4?\nTom Siebel: Let\u2019s see. I have to look at the pipeline. I don\u2019t really have that one on my desk, Pat. I mean, I would say that we did see a number of deals move out Q4 into Q1 and Q2. They had \u2013 they didn\u2019t disappear and they weren\u2019t lost. They just kind of moved and they love to \u2013 there\u2019s still lumpiness in the business. We did close how many deals in the course of the quarter? 27. So the number of deals is quite high, but we had \u2013 honestly, we had a number of deals that we expect to close in the quarter to continue. So the bookings number was not as high as we\u2019d like to be. That being said, the revenue growth exceeded our expectations and everybody\u2019s expectations for the quarter and for the year.\nPatrick Walravens: Yes. And can I ask how \u2013 so how it\u2019s made in so far?\nTom Siebel: How is what?\nPatrick Walravens: How was the last month, beginning of this quarter?\nTom Siebel: I\u2019m prepared to comment on the business as of the as of the end of the quarter of, Pat. And we\u2019ve given our guidance for what we think is going to happen in Q1. And so far, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve \u2013 I\u2019m really quite confident that we\u2019ve not fallen short of our guidance. I think every quarter we\u2019ve been a public company, we\u2019ve exceeded the guidance, six? Yes.\nPatrick Walravens: Yes. Okay. And so it seems like Bakers Hughes \u2013 I mean last quarter, you called out Baker Hughes because it contributed, I forget what the percentage was, but a really big percentage of the bookings. So with Baker Hughes seems like it was softer this quarter. Is that a fair assessment?\nTom Siebel: Well, oil and gas was 13% of our business in bookings. So I mean it was pretty strong, and oil and gas last year grew by 95%, which is pretty strong in bookings. So I would not describe it as soft. Did some oil and gas deals move out of the quarter?\nTom Siebel: Yes.\nPatrick Walravens: Yes. Okay. And then\u2026\nTom Siebel: Business is quite healthy.\nPatrick Walravens: Okay. Great. And then Juho, one for you, which is \u2013 so can you repeat the how much of the \u2013 you have a $100 million buyback plan, right? And I think you told us how much you had bought back and I missed that.\nJuho Parkkinen: Yes, it was $15 million, 720,000 shares.\nPatrick Walravens: 720,000 shares. Okay. Great. Thank you. Sorry, last one. One more for you, Juho, what will free cash flow for this coming year if the operating loss is minus 75% to minus 86%, how should we think about free cash flow?\nJuho Parkkinen: Well, yes, that\u2019s a great question. I think on a cash flow basis, we still have a lot of lumpiness in that. I think on a more longer term perspective as we are going to reach the operating profit goals that I outlined, you are going to start seeing a more sustained operating or free cash flow positive. But as we march towards that goal, there is going to be lumpiness. There is going to be periods where we are going to be closer to positivity and then periods where we are going to be a little bit more free cash flow spend.\nPatrick Walravens: Okay. Just so we don\u2019t have unpleasant surprises in Q1. So, just for Q1, you guided an operating loss of negative 23 to 28. Should we expect cash flow to be in that range, worse, better, how should we think about it?\nJuho Parkkinen: Well, I think \u2013 yes, that\u2019s a good question, Pat. I think more broadly speaking, again, there is going to be \u2013 we are going to have some activities. I think one of the things that you are aware of is that we are having the build-out on the new lease. And as part of that, we will be incurring some cash outflow items, which don\u2019t show up as operating expenses until years after since they are capitalized as part of the new office.\nTom Siebel: We had tenant improvements in the office building that we are moving into.\nPatrick Walravens: Okay. Alright. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from Brad Sills with Bank of America. Please proceed.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey. This is Adam on for Brad. Thanks for taking our question. So, for Juho, just a quick one. How should we be thinking about the Q1 guide in terms of the mix between subscription and professional services revenue has kind of been moving into a higher mix of pro-services. So, just wanted to get your take on how we should be thinking about that going forward?\nJuho Parkkinen: I think that\u2019s a great question. We have said earlier that we think a long-term target for this mix is probably in the 10% to 15% range. Obviously, this quarter, we ended at 22%. Last quarter, I think it was 18%. I think you should expect somewhere to be in the mid-teens, but there is still going to be some activities in the quarter that may change that. But I think that\u2019s a fair assumption at this point.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Super helpful. And then a quick one for Tom. You guys kind of called out in the press release the extension of One Medical. Can you just talk about what the lining point looked like and then how that ultimately evolves into becoming an X mark in the customer? Thank you.\nTom Siebel: X mark, I believe that One Medical began as an X mark customer and has expanded as an X mark customer. So, if I am not mistaken, \u2013 that\u2019s the extent of the product we have many customers that are only using X mark. The \u2013 regarding the professional services question, I want to say \u2013 I mean, think about kind of what\u2019s going on and what we do where we are investing \u2013 maybe we have a $1 million deal or a $10 million deal or a $20 million deal with a company that makes it very clear that if we succeed then 60 \u2013 there is $100 million in business there. So, for right now, as we establish market presence and we had established successful customers, it\u2019s kind of non-rational for us not to invest professional services in those accounts. Now professional services for us is a very high-margin business. But that being said, when we can take a company from \u20ac300,000 to \u20ac120 million and do that kind of over and over again to not invest in professional services in the few years to get them live. I would suggest, I mean it\u2019s not rational for us not to do that. And in the short-term, it\u2019s pushed up our professional services revenue a little higher than we would like to see. But we are achieving the objective of market penetration.\nUnidentified Analyst: Alright. It sounds good. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from Michael Turits with KeyBanc. Please proceed.\nEric Heath: Hey. This is Eric Heath on for Michael. On the couple of deals you called out is pushing out of the quarter. I was curious if there was any commonalities across those deals either by geography or a vertical?\nTom Siebel: I would say, across verticals and it\u2019s across geographies, some using it budget approval or to get something signed by some senior executive and it didn\u2019t get signed in time or there is some committee that needed to go to or the committee didn\u2019t get scheduled. And some of these are in Europe, it\u2019s kind of Europe, the deals on Euro time. And so it\u2019s \u2013 many of these are large organizations with a very erratic and their processes. And we need to get Board approval or CEO approval or CFO approval or whatever happened and just \u2013 they are operating on their timeline and not ours. That\u2019s all. But I would say it\u2019s pretty much across industries and across geographies. It was not \u2013 we didn\u2019t see any specific industry fall apart. And I would say given kind of the market dynamics of what\u2019s going on with supply chain disruption, I mean probably one of our biggest products is supply network risk and cast optimization of the supply chain. This is becoming really mission critical and associated with all of our applications where, as you can see from our presentations, our discussions with the customers is how much money are they saving in a year. So, as people start to tighten their belts in a what might be an economy that\u2019s turning down, we provide tools that enable them to tighten their belts very cost effectively.\nEric Heath: That\u2019s helpful. And then just got some nice drawdown of the $500 million authorization in the DoD this quarter. So, just curious what else you might be seeing in the pipeline, specifically with the DoD and maybe just any broader commentary about opportunities you see in the Federal space?\nTom Siebel: DoD business looks good, okay. I had were \u2013 we had continued penetration in the Air Force with RSO. That is now accelerating at a \u2013 I think that offers a big opportunity to accelerate. We have two or three other agencies in the defense and intelligence communities that have made, okay, and our process in large C3.ai procurements. So, we have, I think $600 million in dry powder there almost to draw down, okay. And in contract vehicles that are in place, and we are working on additional contract rails at the same time. So, we are very optimistic about the U.S. Defense, Intelligence and Civilian businesses.\nEric Heath: Got it. Thanks. That\u2019s all for me.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from Bob Huang with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\nBob Huang: Hi. This is Bob sitting in for Sanjay today. Thanks for taking the question. So, first, maybe if we can talk about just the billings for the next quarter and maybe for the full year a little bit. obviously, fourth quarter billings are seasonally high, but it was probably a little bit lighter than what we thought it would have been. Maybe if you can just give us sort of a trajectory or a better understanding of how we should think about sellings going forward for the next 12 months or so?\nTom Siebel: Juho, do you want to?\nJuho Parkkinen: Yes. Thanks, Bob, for the question. So, I think some of the things that ties to what I was mentioning earlier to Pat on the cash flow items. So, we transact in \u2013 we have large deals with large multinationals and these individual payment terms with specific customers impact the calculated billings metric that you are looking at. So, at this point in our company, we are going to have a lot of lumpiness that you see this you could have an individual quarter where the calculated billings looks really good, and then the next quarter, it could be a little bit less. So, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a metric that you need to focus on, particularly intensity.\nBob Huang: Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. My next question, just \u2013 you obviously had some quite a bit of success on the energy sector, oil and gas and such. In terms of various verticals that you are in as well as geography, like, for example, Europe versus U.S., oil and gas versus machinery. What verticals are you confident or feel good about going forward? And what are maybe some of the verticals or areas that you might want to keep a closer eye on going forward?\nTom Siebel: Energy looks strong. Utilities look strong. Oil and gas looks strong. Chemicals looks strong. Manufacturing looks strong. Really haven\u2019t penetrated telco yet. I think there are big opportunities there. Financial services, I think there are big opportunities there. We are starting now to penetrate consulting companies, EY, PwC and others. I think there is going to be a big opportunity there. We are providing them tools to accelerate their \u2013 what they do. So, yes, I think it\u2019s \u2013 the question is, I mean ultimately, this is just like CRM or like ERP, all industries adopt, it\u2019s just at which industries adopt at which rates. And interestingly enough, we are seeing a lot of interest in agribusiness, which is a huge supply chain problem globally as it relates to agribusiness, as the world faces kind of potential famine associated with wheat and rice production. So, we are doing there with some work with Cargill and others that\u2019s really interesting and really important. In general, we don\u2019t really see right now a lot of softness out there, but we do read the newspapers, should read what you guys write, and we haven\u2019t seen a lot of the newspapers. And while we don\u2019t see it, our business looks quite good. I think as long as we didn\u2019t read the newspapers, or turn off the TV, everything would be fine.\nBob Huang: Thanks for that. That\u2019s very helpful.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from Pinjalim Bora with JPMorgan. Please proceed.\nTom Siebel: It looks like we lost JPMorgan.\nPinjalim Bora: Sorry, I was \u2013 I think I was talking to myself on mute. Apologies. I wanted to ask you about the deals that got pushed out. From your conversations with those customers, is it entirely driven by macro-related considerations, or do you think is there an element of the sales organization changes that you have done or the amount of sales capacity that you have currently given the tight labor market?\nTom Siebel: Sales capacity has grown pretty considerably. Really, we have been \u2013 so it\u2019s not a sales capacity issue. It\u2019s just \u2013 I mean I am looking at these transactions that we expected to close, here is one in the United States Government. Here is an insurance company. This is an oil and gas company. Here is a beltway band at the large energy company in Europe, a pharmaceutical company in Europe, a bank in Canada, food services company in the United States, a retailer in Europe, civilian agency, oil and gas company. I am going right out of the list. Oil and gas company in Africa, U.S. Federal Agency, U.S. Federal Agency, U.S. Federal Agency, large big box retailer, division of the Air Force. Here is a company, I don\u2019t know what they do, the division of defense, large food provider, local, a county with roughly 1 million people in it, a large credit card provider, U.S. Intelligence Agency. So, insurance \u2013 can I just read right down the list, okay. Of deals that we are looking at, that we were expecting \u2013 I would say, particularly the ones that we were absolutely expecting in the quarter would be Intel agency, insurance company, a large European oil company, beltway integrator, European energy company, European pharmaceutical company, large exchange, Stock Exchange, bank in Canada, food services company and manufacturing company in Wisconsin. So, it varies \u2013 it\u2019s across industries, across geographies, and it\u2019s just \u2013 it\u2019s not that their business has gone south. They are going under. It\u2019s just that they did \u2013 they are processed in time.\nPinjalim Bora: Understood. I guess one thing that people trying to understand...\nTom Siebel: That was not memory. I was reading down the list.\nPinjalim Bora: Yes. Understood. Well, the follow-up to the \u2013 my follow-up would be that AI obviously \u2013 or C3.ai, obviously saves a lot of money when deployed. You have really big economic benefits, right, when deployed. However, it seems like it\u2019s a factor of the large initial outlay, which is kind of creating these problems, right? Otherwise, people should probably adopt AI during a slower economic environment. Won\u2019t you say?\nTom Siebel: Well, I am not sure. I mean the initial outlay sometimes is $50,000, sometimes is $10,000. The initial outlay at a $300 billion oil company was $300,000, which were might seem like a lot \u2013 it\u2019s not a lot for a $300 million company. So, I am not sure the initial outlays that I accept that. As you saw from the slides that I showed you, frequently, the initial outlay is $50,000 or $300,000 and then it grows every time.\nPinjalim Bora: So, the average is...\nTom Siebel: Is large compared to a lot of the other things that you look at in the AI space where I think their average sales price is like $20,000, we are not in that game.\nPinjalim Bora: Alright. Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: There are no further questions for you at this time. So, I will pass the call back over. Go ahead.\nPaul Phillips: Right. Thanks, everybody, for your time. We will wrap up the call now and appreciate everyone\u2019s interest. Have a good rest of your day.\nTom Siebel: Thanks everybody.\nOperator: That concludes the C3.ai earnings call of the fourth quarter fiscal year 2022. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines."}, {"symbol": "AI", "quarter": 3, "year": 2022, "date": "2022-03-02 21:30:23", "content": "Operator: Good afternoon, and thank you for attending today's C3 AI Third Quarter Fiscal Earnings Call. My name is Amber, and I will be your moderator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] It's now my pleasure to hand the conference over to our host, Paul Phillips with C3 AI. Paul, please proceed.\nPaul Phillips: Good afternoon, and welcome to C3 AI's earnings call for the third quarter of fiscal year 2022, which ended January 31, '22. My name is Paul Phillips, and I'm the Vice President of Investor Relations. With me on the call today is Tom Siebel, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.

Please be advised that we may or may not continue to provide this additional detail in the future. With that, let me turn the call over to Tom for his prepared remarks. Tom?\nThomas Siebel: Thank you, Paul. And hi, everybody. Thank you for joining us today. I'm very pleased to give you a briefing on the results of the quarter that we recently concluded. It was a great quarter. Our third quarter results displayed strength in all aspects of our business, including revenue growth of 42% year-over-year. New business activity was exceptionally strong. Our results were driven by substantially increased sales momentum, due to the successful refocusing of our sales organization, continually expanding customer count, the continual expansions of the C3 application footprints within existing customers, and increased industry diversification for our AI products and sales. Highlights of the third quarter include revenue. Total revenue for the quarter was $69.8 million, an increase of 42% year-over-year. Subscription revenue for the quarter was $57.1 million, an increase of 34%. Customer count increased 82% year-over-year to 218. Non-GAAP gross profit for the quarter was $55.8 million and 80% gross margin. And significantly, our GAAP RPO now represents 168% of Q3 annualized sales. Let me touch on customer wins and expansions. Business from contracts executed in the quarter showed substantially increased industry diversification. 32% was from utilities, 30% of our business was from chemical industry, 20% from agribusiness, 12% from financial services. I've spoken in the past about our emphasis to increase our business with small and medium customers, and I'm pleased to report that we made excellent progress in that regard. During the quarter, we executed 12 agreements of less than $1 million; 3 contracts between $1 million and $5 million; 2 transactions between $5 million and $10 million and 3 agreements in the range of $10 million to $50 million. Shell, which is one of our largest customers, continues to expand its C3 application footprint with over 10,000 devices currently monitored by C3 AI machine learning models and 23 large-scale assets in production deployment, including Pernis, the largest refinery in Europe and Nigeria LNG. Understand it's an asset, we're not talking about here by a pump or we're not talking about a valve. By asset we're talking about Pernis. Pernis, for those who you know, this is the largest refinery in Europe. I think they process 0.5 billion barrels of oil a day, and this would be an asset the size of, say, order of magnitude of, say, 10 aircraft carriers. So that's what they call an asset. And there are 23 assets that size currently in production. Shell currently processes 1.3 trillion predictions per month with the C3 AI Suite. And Shell expanded both the duration and the scale of its contractual relationship with C3 during the quarter. The Department of Defense awarded C3 AI a 5-year $500 million transaction agreement, accelerating the ability for any DoD agency to acquire the company's suite of enterprise AI application products and services basically without an RFP and without competitive bidding. We achieved a new production deployment with the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency and secured additional business with the U.S. Space Force. LyondellBasell, one of the world's largest plastics and chemical company, signed a 5-year significantly expanded contract to accelerate the deployment of additional enterprise AI and machine learning applications across the company. Royal Philips, a global leader in health technology, closed a new and expanded contract with C3 to enhance resiliency, visibility and agility for Philips supply chains across the company's North American operations. Cargill substantially increased and extended its C3 AI contract to expand its deployment of C3 AI Supply Chain Suite applications. ENGIE, our energy services partner, expanded the use and extended the term of its C3 AI contract to deliver a broader range of AI-enabled end-to-end energy and sustainability think ESG solutions to serve both the public and private sectors. Swift, the global provider of secured financial messaging services, expanded its relationship with C3 AI, leveraging the C3 AI Financial Services Suite. Our business activity with our joint venture alliance partner, BakerHughesC3.ai continues to accelerate globally. I'll talk more about that later, and our customer count increased substantially year-over-year. Touch upon a few other corporate highlights. Sales in the third fiscal quarter, the company successfully refocused its sales organizations to its traditional strategic accounts engagement model, delivering immediate and positive results. Leadership, C3 AI appointed Lisa Davis to its Board of Directors. Lisa is a recognized global leader in industrial and energy industry, bringing more 30 years' experience to the company. She has served in various capacities and leadership positions with several of the world's largest corporations, including Texaco and Shell and as CEO of Siemens Gas and Power. We received some very significant AI tailwinds in the federal sector when the President signed into law in December, the fiscal year 2022 National Defense Authorization Act. And in that act, Section 227 requires that \"the Secretary of Defense shall ensure that to the maximum extent practicable, commercial artificial intelligence companies are able to offer platform, services and applications and tools to the Department of Defense components through processes under Part 12 of the Federal Acquisition Regulations.\" We believe this represents a secular change in procurement policies for AI solutions for DoD requiring primacy in the selection and use of commercial off-the-shelf software solutions from commercial vendors like C3 AI rather than traditional custom development by custom project-specific developers that have been largely proven to be unsuccessful. We believe this will help to continue to accelerate C3 AI's federal business in the coming years. Importantly, C3 AI opened a new software development and professional services center in Guadalajara, Mexico. We plan to hire as many as 1,000 senior software and service engineers in Mexico over the next few years. C3 AI is making this investment to meet the growing global demand for enterprise AI applications and associated services and because the talent pool in Guadalajara is amongst the best in the world. Comment on cash reserves. With $1.02 billion in cash, cash equivalents and investments, C3 AI is well positioned to continue to invest in market leadership through enterprise AI innovation and brand equity and sales expansion. Let me talk for a minute about go-to-market partners. Our most significant go-to-market partners are Microsoft, AWS, Google Cloud and Baker Hughes. Microsoft, we have closed over $250 million in business with Microsoft to date. As I speak, we are currently engaged in over 50 active joint customer discussions. Our qualified joint pipeline that we're ordering together globally is massive. AWS, year-to-date, we've closed over $70 million volume business with AWS, and our AWS joint selling activity has increased substantially in the public sector. Google Cloud, a relatively new partnership. We have 42 joint prospects in active engagement today. Google has assigned a team of 11 full-time professionals to coordinate sales activities with C3. We may literally daily to coordinate sales activities. Google is a platinum sponsor at C3 Transform, our International Users Group conference that will take place in March in Miami. And Thomas Kurian, the Google GCP CEO will be delivering a plenary keynote address at that conference. Baker Hughes remains our most strategic partner. They are also a platinum sponsor of C3 Transform. They will also be delivering a plenary keynote. As you know, in Q3, they expanded their partnership agreement with C3 to substantially increase both the term and the amount of their commitment to us. In the third quarter, 32% of our business was closed through the BakerHughesC3.ai partnership. That's up from 17% or 18% a year ago, and in dollar value, that represents a 700% growth year-over-year. To be clear, all of the business in the partnership in Q3 from the Baker Hughes partnership came from third-party users. None of the business came -- none of the growth in RPO came from Baker Hughes. Baker Hughes currently have 60 full-time professionals coordinating selling with us. Our pipeline and joint sales activities with which we are gauged remains quite healthy. Let me address one more time the -- I'll talk about the addressable market. We are looking at a huge addressable market. Recent data from IDC suggests that the total addressable market for enterprise AI software is exceptionally large to the tune of $365 billion this year and expected to exceed $590 billion in 2025. We believe that C3 AI is, if not the largest, certainly one of the largest participants in this rapidly growing market segment. We continue to be focused on establishing and maintaining market leadership and we believe the company is on track to achieve that objective. Bottom line, it was a great quarter. Sales, growth, partnering, technology leadership and the company is back on track. I wanted to inform you also that last Friday, the company accepted the resignation of Adeel Manzoor, our CFO of 12 weeks, who resigned for entirely personal reasons. Due to the sensitivity of the personal issues involved, we will have no further comment on this matter. That being said, I am pleased to inform you that Juho Parkkinen, our highly experienced Controller and Chief Accounting Officer, has been promoted to the role of acting CFO effective immediately. You'll find that Juho has exceptional expertise and experience in all matters accounting as it relates to C3 AI. And with that, I am pleased to turn that over to my colleague, Juho, to provide additional color on the quarter. Juho?\nJuho Parkkinen: Thanks, Tom. I'll start with a review of our third quarter results. And following that, I'll provide our outlook for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year '22, then we'll be happy to take your questions. First, let's start with the third quarter results. Total revenue for the quarter was $69.8 million, up 42% year-over-year and above our guidance range of $66 million to $68 million. Subscription revenue was $57.1 million, up 34% year-over-year. Subscription revenue was approximately 82% of total revenue in the third quarter compared to 87% a year ago. Professional services revenue was $12.7 million. As Tom mentioned earlier, for the third quarter, remaining performance obligations or GAAP RPO, increased by 90% on a year-over-year basis to $469.3 million, up from $247.5 million last year, of which $171.6 million is expected to be recognized over the next 12 months and the remainder thereafter. Non-GAAP RPO increased by 81% to $536.7 million, up from $295.9 million last year. The RPO growth reflects a healthy industry mix as Tom mentioned in his earlier remarks. Baker Hughes-related RPO growth to third-party companies contributed 32% of total growth in RPO compared to 18% a year ago period. As of Q3 FY '22, customer count increased to 218, up 82% year-over-year. We believe this reflects the success of our go-to-market strategy of entering into large enterprise agreements with our customer entities and expanding within those customer entities. During the quarter, we performed an analysis of our customer entity usage and found that our previous customer count did not capture all the distinct divisions, departments, business units or groups within customer entities that are using our software or services. As part of the earnings release under section Other Metrics, we have provided the apples-to-apples comparison of customer count using the appropriate calculation. You will see that we have previously undercounted our customers. We will present the revised calculation of customer on a go-forward basis as we believe this provides more clarity and accuracy. Moving down the income statement. I will be discussing all metrics on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. As a reminder, our non-GAAP amounts exclude stock-based compensation expense and the employer portion of payroll tax expense related to stock transactions. A GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation is provided with our earnings press release. Gross profit was $55.8 million in the third quarter, an increase of 50% from a year ago, primarily driven by revenue growth from new and existing contracts. Gross margin was 80% compared to 76% a year ago. This improvement reflects the inherent leverage in our operating model as our business continues to scale. Subscription gross margin in the quarter was 83%, in line with 84% one year ago, and professional services gross margin was 66% compared to 21% a year ago. Operating expenses were $71.5 million, up 45% from a year ago, reflecting our continuous and planned investments in research and development, brand awareness and sales and marketing. We expect to continue to invest aggressively in sales and marketing and R&D to expand our market share and increase our presence in target industry verticals and geographic markets while continuing to extend our technology leadership position as the enterprise AI software company. All of these initiatives will drive growth in our business. Total operating loss was $15.7 million in the third quarter. Turning to our balance sheet and cash flows. We ended the quarter with $1.02 billion in cash, cash equivalents and investments with no debt. Operating cash flow for the quarter was an outflow of $55.4 million and after capital expenditures of $0.8 million, free cash outflow was $56.2 million. At quarter-end, deferred revenue was $59.4 million compared to $62.3 million in the prior year. We are well positioned to continue to invest in our growth and execute on our growth strategy. Turning to our guidance for the fourth quarter and full year of fiscal '22. Our growing diversified customer base and increased sales momentum reinforces our confidence as we look forward. For the fourth quarter, we expect total revenue in the range of $71 million to $72 million, representing a growth of 36% to 38% from a year ago. We expect to continue to invest in R&D and sales and marketing that will drive the future growth of our business and anticipate a non-GAAP operating loss between $34 million and $30 million. For the full year of fiscal '22, we are increasing our revenue guidance to the range of $251 million to $252 million, representing a growth of 37% to 38%. We anticipate a non-GAAP operating loss in the range of $94 million to $90 million, an improvement from our prior guidance. In addition, the early indicators for Q1 fiscal '23 have us expect a similar total revenue as for Q4 fiscal '22 and for the full year fiscal '23, the analyst consensus is in line with our growth expectations. In summary, we're pleased to report third quarter results that were ahead of our guidance ranges. We are excited about our current sales momentum and customer growth as well as diversification, all of which supports our outlook for the remainder of fiscal '22 and beyond. With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Pat Walravens with JPMorgan.\nPatrick Walravens: It's JMP, it's not JPMorgan. But -- so Mr. Parkkinen, congratulations on the promotion. If you don't mind, I'd like to start with a question for you, and then I'll do one for Tom. And also, thank you, by the way, for giving us a rough idea of what next year should look like. It's very helpful. But the third CFO in a very short period of time. So the question everyone is going to have is are you comfortable that there are no accounting or financial reporting issues at C3?\nJuho Parkkinen: Yes, thank you for that question. Yes, I've been here for a little over a year. I joined as the Vice President of Accounting, very quickly assumed the role of a Controller. In December, I was promoted to be Chief Accounting Officer. And I've been intimately involved with all the financial statements ever since I joined. I have no concerns whatsoever that all of our financials are top-notch and in line with generally accepted accounting principles. I'd like to also add that we have a very, very qualified accounting team. Just in the past year, we've enhanced the capabilities internally significantly, including multiple CPAs, lots of big fore background, lots of master's degrees as well as we use external providers to help us in various technical accounting topics. So overall, I think our accounting is in top shape, and the financial statements are in top shape.\nPatrick Walravens: Okay. Great. That's very helpful. And then Tom, given the just tragic situation that's unfolding in the Ukraine, it seems to me the biggest opportunity in the place that C3 can possibly do the most good is by helping our Department of Defense and maybe that of our allies. So if you could -- to the extent you can, if you can discuss the opportunity there, I think that would be interesting.\nThomas Siebel: Great question, Pat. I think that business activity that we're seeing in the U.S. federal area in the defense intelligence community is very significant. This change in federal procurement policy is very significant, basically mandating the Secretary of Defense put in procedures in place to ensure that commercial software is considered first. And right now, the DoD has 600 build-it-yourself projects. So this affects all 600 of those projects. We are very actively engaged with the Department of the Army, the Department of the Air Force and with some of the intelligence agencies in some very large projects. We just received, as you know, $0.5 billion transaction authorization, making it very easy for these departments to opt to procure with us. So we are expanding that business in a very substantial way. General Ed. Cardon joining us, the Head of Federal Systems, H.R. McMaster recently joining our Advisory Board, Condi Rice on the Board. I think you'll see some additional significant additions to the Federal Advisory team. And I think we're going to be very, very well positioned to help serve the United States federal government and the Department of Defense. And to the extent that we have the opportunity to do so, we consider it a privilege. So I think that looks like a big opportunity, and we are very focused on it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jamie Shelton with Deutsche Bank.\nJamie Shelton: Can you hear me okay?\nThomas Siebel: You're loud and clear, Jamie.\nJamie Shelton: Brilliant. I'm on for Patrick Colville. Just a quick one for me. I noticed customer entities ticked down by 3 sequentially. If possible could you provide any additional color there, if there is any.\nJuho Parkkinen: Jamie, this is Juho. So the customer entities numbers, our starting premise is that we only count as a customer entity or a customer, any such entity that had revenue in the period. So as in our life cycle of a customer, there can be trials in a given quarter that would be included in the customer into the account for that quarter. And at the following quarter, the customer may not yet be ready to convert to an application or a platform purchase. So it could -- they could show up 1 quarter after again on the customer count. So you would be expected to see this type of ups and downs in individual quarters. But overall, the customer entity trend should be going up into the right.\nJamie Shelton: Brilliant. Very clear. And sorry, just one more, if I may. Could you quickly unpack your expectations for subscription versus services growth? Because one is clearly outperforming the other? I mean, how do you kind of look at that going forward?\nThomas Siebel: I think Jamie, you can expect, and we've been pretty consistent in that. I mean, you're going to expect to see that services are going to be in the 15% to 20% range from quarter-to-quarter. And we clearly are a computer software company. We are not a services company. We are focused on staying a computer software company. And we continue to outsource a lot of the services business we do rather than take that revenue ourselves. So that will be the strategy. But you can it's going to kind of bounce around the 15% to 20% range from quarter-to-quarter as it has.\nOperator: There are no further questions in queue. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Sanjit Singh with Morgan Stanley.\nSanjit Singh: Tom, I had a question. I really appreciate the detail on some of the deal sizes. And I think you talked to a dozen or so deals under $1 million, which is pretty unusual for C3, but something you guys were pointing in that direction, too. For those customers or for those deals, what are those customers buying? Is that sort of Ex Machina driving those deals? Is it kind of the -- starting off with a single app? Any sort of context on what those sub $1 million deals as that sort of composed with.\nThomas Siebel: I think there are 3 categories of them, Sanjit. The biggest second there is going to be trials, okay? So we're -- we tend to do paid trials. And they're normally in $400,000 to $600,000 range for a paid trial. Sometimes for a simple trial of proof-of-concept, they will pay $250,000, but that fits in there. And the idea that we would do a trial and the trial being successful that will then convert to a larger enterprise license agreement 1 or 2 or 3 quarters down after the termination of the trial. And then the second category is going to be certainly less than $1 million would be most Ex Machina transactions. And that's really the bulk of it. I mean, sometimes, somebody wants to buy a little bit of professional services work or something like that. But really those first 2 really do cover it. And we'd expect to see that segment, the mix increase going forward.\nSanjit Singh: Right. And so my follow-up question, Tom, is now that you've -- now that we've sort of gone back to that traditional strategic account model and you have sort of new business working again, if I take a pretty simplistic framework and say, federal business, DoD, federal government, that opportunity and then the enterprise opportunity. It seems to me that the enterprise opportunity is fragmented, right? There's tons of players there. And the sort of direction on terms of how buyers want to sort of consume AI still being sort of pushed out. And so the spirit of the question is that when you think about kind of the near term opportunity for growth over the next say 12 to 24 months, should we expect C3 to really double down on federal being the primary driver of growth? Or do you expect that to continue to be sort of a continued balance between both the government business and the nongovernment business?\nThomas Siebel: Great question. Thank you for asking, and the answer is absolutely not, okay? We do not see ourselves as a federal contractor, okay? Because to the extent that we're very active again in discussions with the federal government to the extent that we have the opportunity to say, we're very pleased to do so. I think that federal is going to be 15% of our business, okay, in a steady state in the long run, U.S. Federal, okay? And the balance will be APAC, EMEA and think -- of the balance, I think, 40% North America, 40% EMEA and 20% APAC, ex China, where we don't do business. And so those are absolutely, we are not becoming a federal contractor.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan.\nMark Murphy: Tom, we've had just now Snowflake, and we've had a number of other data and analytics and infrastructure companies that are mentioning a slowdown in consumption trend over the holidays and into January. And there's been a bit of this passing through lower CPU pricing from Amazon and some of the other cloud platforms that's impacting some of these companies. So I'm just curious, based on the pretty good strength of your guidance, should we assume that you did not see any type of slowdown either on the consumption side, I realize it might not impact you directly, but -- or with more users taking longer vacations, anything along those lines?\nThomas Siebel: Well, 42%, I think you can assume that we exceeded any guidance that we gave and any guidance and way above any consensus guidance we might not have been above yours Mark because I know you always give us a high number. We're quite pleased with 42% growth. I mean that's way into the upper decile of rapidly growing software companies. And I think that right now, as it looks -- as we look at what next year looks like, we're comfortable with the consensus guidance that's out there that I think is about 33%. And that's kind of where we are. And so we're -- so I don't think -- we're not seeing a noticeable slowdown. No, sir.\nMark Murphy: Yes. And just to clarify, yes, it's all above my numbers, which were probably pretty in line.\nThomas Siebel: Even your numbers, I didn't know that was possible, okay.\nMark Murphy: Yes, that happened. But yes, I just wanted to try to clarify or to kind of draw that contrast, but it didn't seem like you saw that this probably running around.\nThomas Siebel: I think our growth rate, we should be in the upper decile next year of rapidly growing software companies.\nMark Murphy: Yes, yes. Okay. My other question is...\nThomas Siebel: By the way as it will be this year.\nMark Murphy: Yes. Okay. My other question is the -- I'd like to ask this from time to time, but the commodity price for oil and gas, right, has just gone vertical, I think, in a way that we haven't seen in quite a long time. And so since you have the exposure there, is there anything worth mentioning in terms of the pipeline? Is that -- does that feel like it's tangibly flowing through into more ability to spend for those oil and gas customers?\nThomas Siebel: I mean that's absolute yes, okay, with the exception of oil and gas companies in Russia, okay? So honestly, if we look at Q4 and Q1, okay, we were expecting -- we have been working some time in some business that we expected to see a close in Russia. And I think that at this point, the last time I checked on CNBC, the probability of that closing was pretty low, like I think we can put a 0 on that. And so that is kind of -- so that's what's kind of moderates our, moderates Q4 and Q1 a little bit, but -- so there's 3 deals that are in Russia that are not going to happen in our lifetimes now. But the rest of the oil and gas business -- I assume it doesn't happen in our lifetime. The -- but the rest of the oil and gas business, I mean, these people, I think we can expect to see them invest at a greater rate.\nMark Murphy: Okay. Is it safe to assume that, that nets out positively, if it's 3 deals that won't happen and the rest is in good shape?\nThomas Siebel: Yes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jamie Shelton with Deutsche Bank.\nJamie Shelton: Apologies, guys. I had no question. All good here.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Cikos of Needham & Company.\nMichael Cikos: Thanks for getting me on here with the Q&A. I apologize if this has been discussed previously, but I've been jumping back and forth between a few earnings calls tonight. I wanted to ask about the sales reorganization and the refocusing. I know that you guys have talked about the realignment. Is there anything that you could point to, to help us better -- from a data point perspective, to help us contemplate improvements in either sales activity or improved productivity from the sales reorg that you guys had discussed in the previous quarter?\nThomas Siebel: Yes. First, let me -- thanks for the question, Mike, first. To be clear, there was no sales reorganization. So we've got the same organization in place, but we did change the sales methodology to our traditional strategic kind of selling, okay? So same sales org just different -- traditional means of selling. I think what's the biggest indication that we can give it the success is change in RPO, okay? Help me out, Juho, what was the change in RPO?\nJuho Parkkinen: So I think, Mike, the best way to think about this is to aid the diversity in RPO. If we go sequentially, I know Tom mentioned in the last earnings call.\nThomas Siebel: Let's talk about diversity. So diversity in the increase in RPO would have been 32% from utilities, 30% for chemicals, 20% from agri business, 11% from financial services, 2.6% oil and gas and the rest across life sciences, manufacturing and the other. So it was highly diverse. It was a large number of agreements. What else would you comment that what -- to answer Mike's question, Juho?\nJuho Parkkinen: I think in general, Mike, that the overall activity was just significantly improved in Q3 versus Q2.\nMichael Cikos: Very helpful. Thank you for clarifying on that. And again, I'll apologize because I am coming in a little bit late, but I know -- or one of the things that I want to ask you guys about can you provide any commentary on the either adoption or pipeline building that you're seeing around CRM? And what has been the reception to Data Vision, anything on either of those would be incremental?\nThomas Siebel: Well, we're doing a major release it's called C3 AI Version 8 that we'll release in March that represents a rewrite of almost the entire stack. And then we'll release that at something called C3 Transform, which is our International Users Group, which will be in March in Miami. And Data Vision will be integrated, deeply integrated almost all of our products. CRM is now kind of just being released into the marketplace. There's a lot of interest. I think it's a lot of potential. The CRM market, as you know, this year is $120 billion software -- as you may know, is a $120 billion software and services business. And there seems to be a lot of interest in making these CRM implementations predictive. And by the way, this is what we're doing is not a rip and replace. So we're not going in and proposing to take out Salesforce, Siebel, Dynamics, Veeva, Vlocity or whatever they might have. We just sit on top of that, okay, and make it instantly predictive. So for AI-based, AI-enabled revenue forecasting, predictive relationship modeling, next best product, next best software. So I think there's a high level of sort of interest there. And I think that, honestly, a year from now, it will be a pretty big business, and it takes a little while to build it.\nMichael Cikos: Just building on that, I think on the previous earnings call as well, as it relates to CRM, you had spoken to substantial interest coming from the global SIs for that product and exactly what you said, not the rip and replace so much is the standing up C3 on top of that to drive at that AI that you guys are delivering. So thank you very much. I appreciate you taking the time for the questions.\nThomas Siebel: Thank you. And just recast, that is continuing. And so I mean I think when you get to -- for those of you who at our users conference will participation from Accenture, PwC and others. And so I think there is a big opportunity with the SIs.\nOperator: There are no additional questions waiting at this time, so I will pass the conference back over to the management team for closing remarks.\nThomas Siebel: Thank you all very much for your time. We're very pleased to announce I mean it was an exceptional quarter. We exceeded our expectations. We exceeded the market expectations. I think we got the sales organization back on track. The companies -- our customers continue to accelerate their implementations at a very substantial rate. And I think that as we enter Q4 of this fiscal year, the company is exactly on track, doing exactly what we said we would be doing when we took this company public. So we're kind of feeling quite optimistic. And thank you for your time, and we look forward to continuing this discussion with you. Have a great day, everybody.\nOperator: That concludes the C3 AI Third Quarter 2022 Fiscal Year Earnings Call. Thank you for your participation.

Tom?\nTom Siebel: Thank you, Paul. Good afternoon, everyone. I\u2019m pleased to provide an update on our second quarter results and give you a feel for the state of the business. We finished Q2 quite strong, exceeding Company guidance and analyst expectations on almost all fronts. Top line revenue for Q2 was $58.3 million, a 41% increase over the prior year. This exceeds Company guidance and all published sell-side analyst expectations. Customer count at the end of the quarter increased to 104, up from 64, a 63% increase over Q2 of last year. GAAP RPO ended at $465.5 million, an increase of 74% year-over-year. Our cash burn for the six months -- for the first six months of fiscal year \u201822 was $19.8 million, reflecting increased investments in human capital, marketing and brand equity. We finished Q2 with $1.08 billion in cash and cash equivalents and investments, enabling us to continue to invest in growth for some time. As we entered Q3, our increased revenue visibility and improved sales processes lead us to raise revenue guidance to $62 million (sic) [$66 million] to $68 million for Q3 and $248 million to $251 million for the -- for fiscal year \u201822, representing a 35% to 37% growth rate year-over-year, up from a 17% growth rate in fiscal year \u201821. Let\u2019s address customer momentum. We expanded and extended our strategic partnership with Baker Hughes last quarter for the second time. In June of 2020, we extended the agreement for the first time by extending the agreement for two years and increasing the cash and revenue commitments to C3 from Baker by $130 million. This October, we increased the value of the contract again this time by an additional $45 million to $495 million and extended its term from five to six years, importantly now guaranteeing a minimum of $357 million in revenue to C3 over the next 3.5 years. Now, historically, C3 AI has relied upon a high-touch white-glove service, strategic selling model to acquire and retain customers. In July of 2021 in an attempt to further accelerate revenue scalability and customer adoption, we reorganized sales as an independent unit along kind of traditional hierarchically regimented selling structures, like those in place at SAP and IPF. That proved to be a mistake. While the revenue attainment in the quarter was strong, the overall performance of the sales organization and specifically new sales activity in the second quarter was unacceptable. The management team and I have spent the past month restructuring the global sales function molded in the traditional model that we know to be effective as a high-touch classic strategic selling machine. That process is now complete, and the early indicators are quite positive. Our customer energy has increased, our sales visibility has increased. And the amount of revenue of Q3 revenue that we have closed as of the end of November gives us very high confidence levels in our Q3 revenue forecast. On a positive note, we expanded our enterprise AI footprint in a number of diverse industries, including agriculture, agricultural implements, manufacturing, oil and gas, insurance, financial services, life sciences and energy with new enterprise production deployments at Cargill, Johnson Controls, Shell, a new contract signed with CNHI, Liberty Mutual, a top 5 life sciences company; and new additional business with existing customers, including Cargill and now FIS, Mosaic and PTT Global Chemical. We substantially increased our Public Sector business in defense and intelligence with new production deployments at the U.S. Air Force, new business with the U.S. Space Force and additional business with the Missile Defense Agency. In Q2, our Public Sector business grew 33% year-over-year. We expect that growth rate in this sector to increase substantially in the last two quarters of fiscal year \u201822. Let me talk a little bit about our partner ecosystem. We are off to a strong start with our new strategic partnership with Google Cloud, making significant progress on joint product roadmaps and joint sales pipeline. Our significantly growing joint sales pipeline with Google Cloud contributes to our confidence in increased growth in the second half of this year. I think, our pipeline that we\u2019re currently working with the Google Cloud team is over 90 transactions, totaling as of today, we identified $58 million in business that we\u2019re working together for the second half of this year. Our significant partnership with Microsoft continues apace. I think to date, we\u2019ve closed over I think $220 million in business with Microsoft or something like that. But if I look at the forecast that we\u2019re -- the joint pipeline that we\u2019re working with Microsoft in the second half of this year, looks like roughly 120 transactions that we\u2019re working that total $140 million in business that we\u2019re currently tracking. And all of these pipelines will continue to increase in the course of Q3 and Q4. Through our growing partnership with energy services leader, ENGIE, we advanced our position in energy and sustainability and ESG across multiple industries with deployments at a multinational packaging leader, a major hotel group and an iconic global coffee shop brand where C3 AI is helping manage energy consumption and GHG emissions at more than 12,000 sites. We are seeing huge interest in the new C3 AI CRM offering. CRM software and service represents $120 billion market in 2021. Our best guess is that the total installed base of CRM has to exceed $1 trillion. Okay? Many companies have hundreds of millions of dollars invested in their CRM installations that have been highly customized by their systems integration partners, and they are not seeing returns from those investments. Now, we are seeing substantial interest from the larger CRM systems integrators in leveraging C3 AI CRM as a complementary adjunct to their customers\u2019 existing installed CRM systems, so they are on top of their existing CRM systems and on top of the customizations and modifications they have made, adding a modern simple, intuitive user experience and making their existing CRM investments instantly predictive, including precise AI revenue forecasting, precise AI product forecasting, AI-enabled customer retention, next best product, next best offer, predictive interrelationship management, customer service optimization, AI-based predictive maintenance and service, et cetera. This will be a very large market and a huge growth opportunity for C3 AI. Let me talk a little bit about product innovation. We continue to advance our product leadership in enterprise AI. In Q2, C3 AI announced the launch of C3 AI Data Vision. We believe that C3 AI Data Vision represents a fundamental paradigm shift in the enterprise application user experience model, from today\u2019s rather clunky forms and table-based metaphor to a highly visual, interactive, dynamic knowledge graph experience. Go take a look at it at the website. It\u2019s really exciting. C3 AI introduced two new applications last quarter to serve the needs of county tax assessors. The new C3 AI application\u2019s AI Residential Property Appraisal and C3 AI Commercial Property Appraisal will be marketed nationally and have broad applicability for state and local governments and countries as well as financial service institutions engaged in mortgage lending and related services. This basically dramatically accelerates the time to generate a highly accurate, highly defensible property appraisal with a complete evidence package to basically support that appraisal should be adjudicated. We think this represents a significant growth opportunity to company. This along with C3 AI CRM, C3 AI Ex Machina and other initiatives further our efforts to increase revenue diversity. C3 AI production applications showed expanded industry diversification in the quarter, growing now to 14 industries in Q2 of fiscal year \u201822 compared to 7 industries a year ago, including notable expansions in financial services, life sciences, healthcare, manufacturing, agriculture and agricultural instruments. Let me address company leadership. We significantly strengthened our leadership team this quarter. And we did so in our federal business with the addition of Lieutenant General H.R. McMaster, U.S. Army retired, to the C3 AI Advisory Board. A graduate of the U.S. Military Academy and a veteran of the Gulf War Operation Enduring Freedom, and Operation Iraqi Freedom, Lieutenant General McMaster served as the United States National Security Advisor from 2017 to 2018. He has held multiple roles in the United States Central Command and is a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution and lecturer at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. I\u2019m also most pleased to announce that Adeel Manzoor has joined the Company in the role of Senior Vice President and Chief Administrative Officer. Adeel has a rich history in information technology, formerly serving as Chief Financial Officer at Telenav, a wireless location-based services corporation. Prior to that, he served as a Vice President and Business Unit CFO of the Storage, Big Data and Value Compute business at Hewlett Packard Enterprise. He also served as Vice President and Business Unit CFO of the Converged Infrastructure business unit at HPE. Effective December 3rd, Adeel will also assume the role of CFO at C3 AI. I\u2019m disappointed to announce that David Barter will be retiring from C3 AI for personal reasons effective later this month. David has made many substantial contributions to the success of the Company, and he will be missed. Let me touch a little bit about university relations, because I think this is a particular area of strength for C3 AI. We continue to support our powerful university ecosystem through the C3 AI Digital Transformation Institute. This is a public-private partnership that consists of C3 AI, Microsoft, Lawrence Berkeley Labs, the National Center for Supercomputing Applications, UC Berkeley, the University of Illinois-Urbana, MIT, Carnegie Mellon, Princeton, Stanford, and KTH in Sweden The C3 AI DTI sponsors advanced primary research in AI for digital transformation, sponsors industry colloquia, and has awarded significant research funding to develop advanced AI techniques in precision medicine, COVID, pandemic mitigation and energy and climate security. I\u2019ll touch a little bit about human capital. We continue to attract exceptional talent to the Company. The company received, believe it or not, over 18,000 employment applications in the course of Q2. We ended the quarter with 668 full-time employees, an increase of 39% year-over-year. So, in summary, what we have at C3 AI is a high-growth story, and we are laser-focused on growth attainment. We\u2019ve established a substantial leadership position in the nascent stage of the enterprise AI market. The addressable market opportunity in enterprise AI is staggering, promising to exceed a $300 billion software market by 2025. Our purpose is clear. We are here to establish a clear global market leadership position, to establish and maintain clear technology and product leadership, to continue to attract and retain the highest quality human capital, to operate a high-performance global enterprise, to maintain the highest levels of customer satisfaction, to establish thought leadership in enterprise AI, and importantly in ethical AI. I believe our technology foundation is without compare. Our human capital is exceptional. Our brand equity is increasingly positive, the enterprise AI market is large and rapidly growing. We have the technology, we have the leadership, we have the human capital, we have the capital, and we have a huge market opportunity. I believe the market growth opportunity facing C3 AI has never been greater than it is today, and the Company has never been in a better position to establish a global market position, and that is what we intend to attain. So, with that, I will conclude my comments and turn it over to my colleague, David Barter, to drill down further into the financial details. David?\nDavid Barter: Thank you, Tom. We delivered strong second quarter results that again exceeded our guidance ranges for revenue and operating income. At the same time, our notable increase in backlog helps improve our revenue visibility and provides us with confidence in our outlook for the full year. Revenue was $58.3 million, which is above the high end of our guidance, and it represented an increase of 41% from the prior year. Within revenue, subscription revenue was $47.4 million, up 32% from a year ago. Professional services revenue increased to $10.9 million. Despite the higher proportion of professional services revenue in the second quarter, we continue to target our subscription revenue mix in the high 80% range. Our revenue continues to be well diversified across industry verticals and geographies. Five industry verticals each contributed over 10% of our revenue this quarter. Revenue growth from oil & gas and financial services led the way in Q2. We\u2019re also excited about the growth being generated by sales to federal government agencies, and we expect growth in this vertical to increase meaningfully in the second half of the year. Geographically, we also are well diversified. APAC continues to perform particularly well with revenue up 77% in the second quarter. Revenue from customers in EMEA and APAC represented 28% of our first half revenue. The amendment of our JV with Baker Hughes, which Tom referenced in his remarks, enhances our backlog and our revenue visibility. The amendment includes several noteworthy improvements. One, it increased the total contract value by $45 million; two, it extended the JV term by one year; and three, a new pricing model makes it easier for Baker Hughes to further accelerate the sales of C3 AI software. Since future revenue from Baker Hughes is now contracted and committed, the majority of the future revenue related to the JV agreement is now included in GAAP RPO. With this in mind, at the end of the second quarter, current RPO was $179.4 million, up 34% from a year ago and 24% from last quarter. Total GAAP RPO was $465.5 million, an increase of 74% from a year ago and 60% from last quarter. Our cancelable backlog, which is not included in GAAP RPO but has historically converted to revenue, was an additional $63.8 million. Combining our GAAP RPO to cancelable backlog leads to a non-GAAP RPO of $529.3 million, up a meaningful 74% from a year ago and 48% from the prior quarter. We believe these are very healthy metrics which further raise our confidence and visibility. As a reminder, revenue associated with the Baker Hughes JV consists of related party revenue contracted directly with Baker Hughes for their own use or as sell-through to their end customers in oil & gas. The related party revenue in the second quarter was $15.9 million. Nonrelated party revenue derived from transactions assisted by Baker Hughes but the end customer contracted directly with C3 AI was $4.7 million. In total, this produced $20.6 million of revenue from our JV in the second quarter. With the Baker Hughes JV amendment executed in the second quarter, we expect a related party disclosure to be less relevant due to the change in sales model going forward. Turning to expenses and profitability, I will be referring to non-GAAP metrics, which excludes stock-based compensation expense and the employer portion of payroll tax expense related to stock transaction. A GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation is provided with our earnings press release. Gross margin in the second quarter was 77.8%, up 150 basis points from a year ago, reflecting leverage in our operating model as our business continues to scale. Subscription gross margin in the quarter was 81%, consistent with a year ago. And professional services gross margin was 63.8% compared to 47% a year ago. Operating expenses were $67.9 million, up 66% from last year as we continue to focus on executing planned strategic investments to drive our long-term growth. Operating loss was $22.6 million in the second quarter, better than our guidance of a loss of $37 million to $30 million. Turning to our balance sheet and cash flows, we ended the quarter with $1.08 billion in cash, cash equivalents and investments. Operating cash flow was an outflow of $18.9 million in the second quarter. And after capital expenditures of $0.9 million, free cash outflow was $19.8 million. Deferred revenue was $72.9 million at the end of the quarter compared to $82 million in the prior year. Turning to our guidance for the third quarter and the full year. Our amended Baker Hughes JV agreement reinforces our confidence as we look forward. In Q3, we expect total revenue in the range of $66 million to $68 million, representing growth of 34% to 38% from a year ago. We expect to invest thoughtfully in headcount and initiatives that will drive our continued growth and anticipate a non-GAAP operating loss in the range of $30 million to $26 million. For full fiscal year 2022, we are increasing our revenue guidance to the range of $248 million to $251 million, representing growth of 35% to 37%. We now anticipate a non-GAAP operating loss in the range of $108 million to $100 million, which also represents an improvement from our prior guidance. In summary, we\u2019re pleased to deliver second quarter results that exceeded our guidance ranges. We are optimistic about the momentum we are generating in the marketplace, which further supports our outlook for fiscal year 2022. Finally, I\u2019d like to add that it has been a privilege to have been a part of the C3 AI team. I\u2019m very appreciative of the opportunity Tom provided to me and for all his support. We have a strong finance and accounting team, and I\u2019m looking forward to supporting Tom and Adeel with a smooth and thoughtful transition. Before opening up the call for questions, I\u2019d like to invite Adeel Manzoor, our new Chief Financial Officer, to say a few words. Adeel?\nAdeel Manzoor: Thanks, Tom and Dave, for the warm welcome to C3 AI. I\u2019m incredibly excited to be part of the team. The Company has established such a strong strategic position and is off to a great start. I\u2019m looking forward to working with Tom and the team to drive growth and realize Company goals. I\u2019m also looking forward to working with you all. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to the operator for any questions that you may have for us. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question is from the line of Sanjit Singh with Morgan Stanley.\nSanjit Singh: Thank you for taking the questions. And sorry to see you go, David. Best of luck with all your endeavors in the future. Tom, I wonder if you could talk a little bit about some of the motivations around the restructuring of the contract, the first go around with Baker Hughes was right smack in the middle of the pandemic. It made a lot of sense to restructure that contract, extend the life of it. What was the sort of motivation this time and sort of the contribution into in terms of our new RPO? And then, if you sort of exclude the bookings from that from Baker Hughes, if we just sort of look at the business ex Baker Hughes in the quarter, how would you sort of characterize the bookings performance in the quarter? Because it seems like -- it seemed pretty good by our numbers. But then, you sort of hinted at a sort of restructuring in the sales force. I\u2019m trying to put these pieces together and understand like how did bookings evolve relative to your expectations in Q2.\nTom Siebel: Well, there\u2019s a number of questions there. Let me see if I can tease this apart. The real motivation behind restructuring Baker Hughes was to basically kind of realign the sales structure. So, Baker Hughes is I think roughly a $20 billion business, and they run four central business units. And the real relationship with Baker Hughes has to do with their deep, deep energy expertise, in oil and gas, process industries and chemicals -- petrochemical business. I mean they are kind of the masters of the universe of that. And they have these unbelievably close relationships going back now I think 70 years with everybody in the world from Rosneft to Gazprom to Aramco to Shell, Chevron, you name it, okay. And those relationships and that expertise are in their four business units. When we first put together the relationship with C3 AI, Baker Hughes, they basically formed a new business unit that was called Baker Hughes C3 Ai that sat kind of outside of those organizations. And so they really weren\u2019t the people with the relationships, and they weren\u2019t the people with the quotas, and they weren\u2019t the people with the deep industry expertise. And what we really did here was -- is we restructured it in a way that we put all the sales resources and the quota in the operating units of Baker Hughes, okay? And so that\u2019s where the relationships are. That\u2019s really whether we\u2019re talking about the Ecopetrols, the Qatargases, the KMG, [ph] Shell, and so with the quota and the people in the operating units. That was the nature of the restructuring. But we also did this in a way that gave them kind of increased pricing flexibility, to price in a manner that\u2019s consistent with that business segment? Be it LNG, okay, be it deep water, be it renewables, be it petrochemicals. So we gave them the flexibility in consideration, what they -- for us given them that flexibility, what they gave to us was irrevocable nonrefundable revenue commitment. So that becomes hard RPO. I think $352 million, if I\u2019m not mistaken.\nDavid Barter: $357 million over the next 3.5 years.\nTom Siebel: 357 over the next 3.5 years. So, that\u2019s a pretty significant, roughly $100 million a year baseline that we start from, that we could build on top of. So, I\u2019m confident that\u2019s in the best interest of the shareholders of C3. So, it\u2019s a win-win relationship. It allows them to accelerate their business as the oil & gas industry recovers. And it\u2019s a good thing. As it relates to the sales organization, the attempt was and candidly, I think we did it too early, was to put together kind of your traditional, highly hierarchical, highly regimented, independent business unit sales organization, like they have at SAP, like they have at IBM, like they used to have at Oracle. And the idea is, you let a sales organization like that run kind of independently and theoretically you then scale the business at a greater rate. Now, that\u2019s a different model than we\u2019re used to using. Because I know many of you kind of always asked, well, how many people do we have in the sales organization. And it\u2019s really the answer was how many people we have in the Company. That\u2019s all the people in the sales because we always put together sales teams from engineering, from forward engineering, from product marketing, from the office of the CEO, whatever it took to take care of the customer. And I think candidly, we did too early. And the performance of the organization was unacceptable. And so, we watched it. We watched it, we watched it very carefully. It became apparent that it was not going to meet the growth needs of the Company going forward. So basically, we reverted to our old selling -- old strategic selling model, which is a tried, tested, proven technique that many companies are familiar with. It was developed in 1988 by Robert Miller and Stephen Heiman in a book called Strategic Selling, a pretty good book if you haven\u2019t read it. And so now, we\u2019ve gone back to what we did before is for every account, we put together a team of 4 or 5, 6 or 7 people who we think are just the best people in the Company to handle that account; be they from finance, be they from engineering organization, product marketing, from the sales organization or from the office of the CEO, to surround the customer, develop a strategic partnership with the customer, make sure their trial is successful, their implementation is successful, that their production deployments are successful. And this is what we\u2019ve done. It took us about two weeks to actually put all that in place. It all basically has been in place since the first day of this quarter. It\u2019s a done deal. We\u2019re off to the races. And based about what we\u2019re seeing now, it was absolutely the right thing to do. We have a lot of visibility into Q3 and a large pipeline for Q4. And to the extent that going to a hierarchal model was a mistake, I guess I\u2019m the CEO, so I have to accept responsibility for that. But we\u2019ve made course correction, and we\u2019re back on track.\nSanjit Singh: I appreciate all the color on that. That\u2019s super helpful. One more if I might, and this is only sort of partnerships go to market. So, I think you called out a number of them, but the one that sort of perked my ears was Google Cloud and Microsoft. What\u2019s driving the momentum behind that partnership? Is it one of the specific apps you guys did? Is it the CRM app that\u2019s driving a lot of the go-to-market collaboration around that particular approximately, or is it the broader platform or even a whole host of other apps? If you can sort of give us some color or the momentum between with Microsoft and Google Cloud, that would be really helpful.\nTom Siebel: Well, it\u2019s really different between the two. I would say that if you look at the DNA between the Microsoft sales organization and the C3 sales organization, they\u2019re actually very similar. These people are really highly professional experienced enterprise sales professionals. And we just kind of understand how to approach accounts together, how to address opportunities together. They talk together in shorthand and figure out how to get the deal done to the customer satisfaction and how to make the customer succeed. That has been a hugely, hugely successful relationship. It is directly between Justin and Satya and Ed and everybody else, but it\u2019s at the highest levels. And we -- and that is a very, very successful relationship. They look at -- their motivation is to drive Azure, okay? Now, Google approached us from a very different perspective. So, Thomas Kurian when he took over Google, and I think he had about 400 salespeople. I suspect they\u2019re all gone, okay? And now they\u2019ve got about 4,000 salespeople. Most of them are kind of experienced enterprise salesmen and women from SAP and other companies. He decided to approach the hyperscaler market. He\u2019s been very clear that he wanted to approach the hyperscaler market from a different competitive edge. So, rather than approach -- rather than compete with AWS and Azure based upon CPU seconds and storage hours and with arguably a better architecture, he wanted to approach it through the application layer and deliver a family of applications for manufacturing, for consumer packaged goods, for telecommunications, for life sciences, for financial services, and for aerospace, defense and intelligence. So, he wanted to approach it by delivering applications, tried, tested, proven, enterprise AI applications that run on top of the Google Cloud that deliver solutions rapidly to the customer. Now, that\u2019s a pretty interesting and I think defensible and creative market differentiating strategy. Now, the net effect of it is it accelerates the sale of CPU seconds to storage hours. It just gets you there a lot quicker. So, if you were in the market and you wanted to partner with somebody that they had 10, 20, 30, 40 turnkey enterprise applications that run on top of the Google Cloud, that address the value chains of oil & gas, utilities, energy, manufacturing, healthcare, financial services, manufacturing, et cetera, I would argue this is actually one door in the world that you could knock on, okay? And that\u2019s the door right on the front of this building. So that\u2019s the door to knock on, that\u2019s the relationship we put together, and now we\u2019re jointly selling these applications globally. And it\u2019s a really interesting and productive relationship.\nSanjit Singh: I appreciate all the detail, Tom. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Singh. The next question is from the line of David Hynes with Canaccord.\nLuke Morison: Hey, guys. This is Luke on for DJ. Thanks for taking the questions. So, you called out in your prepared remarks the fairly significant uptick in professional services revenue in the quarter. Could you just expand there and discuss what drove that dynamic? Is that just a reflection of new large customer relationships ramping, or is there anything else to call out there?\nDavid Barter: It\u2019s a great question. There\u2019s really nothing to call out. Our subscription revenue over time has averaged 86%, but it\u2019s moved around 5 or 6 points in any quarter -- given quarter. And this just has to do with timing of projects and deliveries. So, nothing more to that than just timing and execution.\nTom Siebel: So, you can expect that to stay -- professional services will stay in the 14% to 20% range of revenue in perpetuity. And that\u2019s kind of where we have it targeted.\nLuke Morison: Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then maybe just another on sort of the government opportunity out there. You obviously had a big quarter in terms of signing new contract value with those three agencies you called out. Do you feel like there\u2019s fruit to be had there, or how would you characterize that opportunity going forward? Thanks.\nTom Siebel: I think that opportunity is huge. And I think we\u2019ve had a General Ed Cardon joined us as -- in the capacity of Chairman of Federal Systems. H.R. McMaster, General McMaster has now joined us. I think you can expect some significant announcements going forward. And we\u2019re quite confident that our business in federal, particularly defense and intel, is going to grow at a substantially increased rate in the second half of this year.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Jack Andrews with Needham.\nJack Andrews: Tom, you talked about sort of this continued need for a high-touch sales approach. And so, I was wondering if you could maybe tie that into just the overall state of the market here. I mean, there\u2019s so much noise, it feels like, around AI in general. So, could you just maybe frame for us. I mean, do your customers, given the healthy pipeline activity, does everyone out there really understand the concept of enterprise AI and all the use cases, or do you still need to spend time sort of evangelizing the value proposition of everything that you can deliver to customers?\nTom Siebel: Great question. Right now, if you look at the pipeline that we\u2019re working going out the next four quarters, it\u2019s about $1.2 billion, okay. The pipeline that we\u2019re working for the second half in what we see as qualified opportunities second half of this year is about $800 million. We are looking at a market that is in -- this is the first half of the first inning, okay, in enterprise AI. And people are just starting to figure it out. And we\u2019re not really spending a lot of time evangelizing. We\u2019re not spelling -- basically, there\u2019s kind of two schools of three schools of thought as it relates to AI. One, I\u2019m like completely confused and I don\u2019t get it yet. That would be the largest segment, okay? The next segment is, well, I\u2019m going to take 20,000 people in Bangalore and I\u2019m going to build this platform myself, okay? And virtually, every one of our customers has tried to build this themselves. It\u2019s long, it\u2019s expensive. It never works. I mean GE, I think, spent $6 billion. Shell tried to build it, and Enel tried to build it, everyone -- Coke tried to build it. There\u2019s no -- United States Air Force, God knows how many times they\u2019ve tried to build it. And we don\u2019t really fight that fight. So, we let people kind of go through that first deciding that they want -- once they get to the point that they\u2019re going to take advantage of enterprise AI, that\u2019s the first qualifying issue. And then, when they\u2019ve gotten to the point where they decided they\u2019re not going to build it themselves, that\u2019s -- so we\u2019re not going to stay around and talk them out of building it themselves. We\u2019re not going to stay around to convince them why AI is good. We\u2019re mostly in the business of just finding that customer that is number one, committed to easily transform the organization and has decided, no way are we going to build it themselves because that\u2019s stupid, okay? When we find that customer, that\u2019s -- we\u2019re not -- we\u2019re spending time qualifying, not evangelizing. It is a -- before it\u2019s all over, everybody will be in that third sector, I\u2019m quite confident of that. And we\u2019ll be looking at a $300 billion addressable market. It\u2019s just an evolution the market has to go through, and we\u2019re -- we have no problem with that.\nJack Andrews: Got it. Thanks for the color. That\u2019s really helpful for me. Maybe just as a follow-up question, just given the sort of the sales changes that you\u2019ve made, could you maybe update us in terms of your hiring plans and priorities for the balance of the fiscal year here?\nTom Siebel: Well, we had 18,000 job applicants in the last quarter. So, we are very -- I mean we\u2019re -- for some reason, we\u2019re just -- I think the last time I looked at the last year, we had 52,000, okay? But the last -- right now, I think 18,000 annualizes to what, 72,000, okay? And -- fast math. And so, we have lots of people who want to come to work here in sales, in data science, in product marketing. You can expect that we will -- we\u2019re very selective about who we hire, both in terms of personality type and in terms of skill set, I think something like 86% of our people have advanced degrees, right about that, Jack. It\u2019s a huge number. I think -- or excuse me. I\u2019m sorry, 68% of our people have advanced degrees, 10% of our people have PhDs. Rough numbers, so you give me a couple of points one way or the other on those guys. I don\u2019t have these numbers right in front of me, okay? But it\u2019s -- you can expect that we will hire every person that we deem to be qualified, who we think can succeed here in the next 2 quarters and in the next 2 years. And so, we are open for business. We\u2019re hiring. We\u2019re hiring at Guadalajara. We\u2019re hiring in New York, in Paris, in Rome, in the UK, and New York, Atlanta, Chicago. And right here in Redwood City, we\u2019re hiring. So, it\u2019s -- and we feel very fortunate about the people that we\u2019re able to attract and retain.\nJack Andrews: That\u2019s great to hear Thanks for the update.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Michael Turits with KeyBanc.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Michael Berg [ph] on for Michael Turits. You called out strength in APAC. And I was wondering if you could dive into that a little bit, and then compare that to what you\u2019re seeing in EMEA? Thanks.\nDavid Barter: Sure. I think what we shared on the call is that APAC was up 77%. I think the strength, if I think about the deals that we\u2019ve had in APAC and just thinking about the last couple of quarters, it\u2019s been certainly financial services. I think we\u2019ve seen some oil and gas, some chemicals. So I think it hits a number of industry verticals is what we\u2019ve seen in APAC.\nUnidentified Analyst: And then, if I could just get a quick follow-up. Is there anything you\u2019d comment on the billings sequential change, any timing -- or just strange seasonality around that? Thanks.\nDavid Barter: I don\u2019t think so. I think overall if you think about billings, probably the most noteworthy element is just to kind of keep in mind that sequentially, things have been very strong if you were to going to go back over 121% the -- going back to Q4, 18% sequential. So, I think sequentially when you think about it, we were kind of coming off of a higher period. So, that\u2019s just -- I just keep in mind that there\u2019s going to continue to be some movement around invoicing and how that percolates through the P&L.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Brad Sills with Bank of America.\nBrad Sills: I wanted to ask about some of the newer vertical industries that you\u2019re going after: life sciences, manufacturing, IT services. Did you kind of expand into these other verticals? What kind of traction are you seeing there? Any color on perhaps applications that you\u2019re seeing some early pilots with, and what pipelines look like potentially in those industries? Thank you.\nTom Siebel: Hi Brad. I wish I had all the pipelines in front of me. I don\u2019t have that done. Jack, do you have a sheet by vertical that I look at? Financial service is going to be huge, Brad. That\u2019s a big one. I mean, now we\u2019re moving into agriculture, believe it or not, agricultural implements, insurance, telco. I mean, this is going to go everywhere. I think consumer packaged goods will be good. We\u2019re not -- it won\u2019t be big, we\u2019re not there yet. The largest, unquestionably the largest where we haven\u2019t made a lot of traction yet, will be precision medicine. No way that could not be the largest. It has to be. So, I mean, it\u2019s just a matter of these markets will develop. For some reason in the utilities, I know why the utilities market was the first to develop. Because they -- when you remember when you used to everybody used to talk about IoT, these three guys have had all the sensors out there. Oil and gas kind of came as a complete surprise. I mean that came in the course of a gift horse who walked through in the door in the person of Baker Hughes. And then defense and intelligence. Oh my God! I mean how big will that be? I mean, these guys are -- financial services pipeline is very large in the second half of the year. Telecommunications is very large. Defense and intelligence -- defense and intel, these poor guys have to keep up with the Chinese. God knows how many scores of billions the Chinese are spending on this. And so, they have some work to do, and I think you\u2019ll find it will be part of the solution. So, we\u2019re just -- we\u2019re going after the verticals in kind of very pragmatic, coin-operated fashion. And as the CEO walks you in the door and with a check and a mandate, he happens to run Boeing or the aerospace business. That\u2019s how it works.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Thanks. And then also, if I could ask about some of these vertical partnerships, FIS, ENGIE. If you could elaborate just a little bit on the commitment there, go-to-market resources, any traction you\u2019re seeing in those partnerships would be really helpful. Thanks again.\nTom Siebel: ENGIE is pretty mature, and that\u2019s one where we\u2019re seeing a lot of traction. And candidly, what they\u2019re doing is they\u2019re using our technology to provide energy services to large organizations like Ohio State University and others. Large retailers of coffee that will remain unnamed on a number of university systems where they\u2019re basically almost stepping in as the role of the utility, okay, where they are kind of guaranteeing them a reduction in their energy and carbon footprint over the next decade or 20 years. And they\u2019re using our software at the heart of that service that they provide. So that is mature, growing, hugely successful. FIS is relatively new. As you\u2019re aware, I think it was put in place a couple of quarters ago. We\u2019re seeing slow but steady progress there. I am touch regularly with the guys who run the business. That is -- right now, I\u2019m optimistic about it, but we have not yet generated a lot of results there. I think, over the next two quarters, we\u2019ll know whether that\u2019s going to succeed or not. I think it will. I spent the morning -- I have regular communication with the person who runs the kind of defense business at Raytheon, who is our partner in the defense and intelligence community. And their levels of commitment are definitely increasing. We\u2019re involved in some very large projects with them. And you can expect to see that those projects will contribute some of the growth that we\u2019ve -- that David mentioned and I have mentioned in the second half of this year. So, that Raytheon is a good one.\nOperator: The final question is from Mark Murphy with JPM.\nMark Murphy: So, Tom, I was curious. When you look back on it with a few more quarters under your belt, what is your preferred route to market, or what is more efficient? Is it selling direct and letting companies build their own machine learning and AI models, or is it weaponizing the older applications by working the way you are with Microsoft and Adobe and Infor and other application vendors?\nTom Siebel: Great question. I\u2019d tell you, it\u2019s a lot years [ph] here, Mark, to weaponize existing systems okay? It really is, or just go take in account, say it Shell, say it Enel, say it Coke, say, the Missile Defense Agency, take an account and make them successful. Build the first half and the second half. And I think for example there for us, we must have 22 applications live in readiness, or will be live, I think, in March. And so, that\u2019s preferred. It\u2019s easiest, okay. It\u2019s highly certain, because you have control over the situation. You\u2019re dealing directly with the customer. You can -- you not only set their expectations, you could influence what they\u2019re going to do first and second and third. And very much about succeeding at this is picking the right project, as you know. The reason that I think a lot of these companies fail at these projects is because of the big projects that are, A, either impossible. Like let\u2019s say, somebody wants to build an AI application to like predict the price of pork bellies next month. Well, if we can predict the price of pork, if AI were that sophisticated, we can predict the price of gold next month, and we could predict the price of Google stock next month. And if we could do that, then obviously would be in the software business, would we, okay? People actually do try to do these applications, believe me. One was explained to me yesterday. So, either people choose applications that are impossible or people to choose applications that are of low value. Now when you\u2019re dealing with them directly, you can push them and keep them on high-value applications where AI is an appropriate tool. Now, that being said, if you want to establish and maintain a market leadership position, as you know we do, you need to think about market leverage, okay? And this is when you\u2019re going through, you\u2019re going through a much larger scale, through distribution partners like Microsoft, like Google, like FIS, like Baker Hughes. The advantage is your own scale. We have 12,000 people with Baker Hughes, 4,000 people at Google, I think 60,000 people at Microsoft. I don\u2019t know what the number is but it\u2019s some staggering number like that. So, the good news is there, you have leverage. It\u2019s harder. You need to be much more sophisticated about the way you\u2019re doing it. You need to be willing to allow people to make mistakes. You\u2019re going to have higher rates of failure. At the same time, you do have market leverage. And if you -- and if the goal is to establish and maintain a clear market leadership, you need to do it through a partner ecosystem. So, as much as I would prefer to do it the easy way, it\u2019s not going to achieve the desired objective. Sorry to go full circle on it, but I mean it was a really good question.\nJack Andrews: Yes. Okay. Yes. Thank you, Tom. I appreciate that insight into the strategies. But my other question is just observing what has happened with commodity prices. And they\u2019re up so much year-over-year. You have this chunk of business in oil & gas and utilities, although you\u2019re diversifying very rapidly. Is the commodity price creating more budget there for that end market? Would you head into 2022? And I guess, I was just curious, if that\u2019s benefiting Baker Hughes, has that given them more confidence to kind of make this stronger commitment to you?\nTom Siebel: Well, there\u2019s no question that as it relates to that segment of our market, it\u2019s a lot easier to do business there when oil prices are like above zero. When oil prices were I think negative $37 a barrel, I mean all these companies were thinking about is how fast they can lay people off, right, and how fast they can slash budgets. They were all in shock. Now with -- I don\u2019t know where oil is today. You probably do. But I suspect it\u2019s something like $86 a barrel, but I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t really check it. But it\u2019s significantly non-zero, and they\u2019re all investing. They\u2019re all investing in the future. Interestingly enough, most of them -- their investment in becoming non-hydrocarbon companies. Certainly Aramco is, certainly Shell is. I mean, they\u2019re all investing and reinventing themselves. When you talk about reinventing, say, a $300 billion business, that\u2019s entirely to that hydrocarbon to be entirely dependent on operating on clean energy, it\u2019s a pretty significant transformation. But there\u2019s no question, they are looking up. And now, there are budgets and they are investing. And I suspect this is one of the reasons that motivated Baker Hughes to restructure agreement the way they did.\nMark Murphy: Okay, I understood. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Murphy. There are no additional questions waiting at this time. I will now turn the conference back over to Tom for any closing remarks.\nTom Siebel: Okay, ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for your time and attention. And we look forward to keeping you posted on the progress of our business, make - we\u2019re very clear on what the mission here is here. And that is to establish and maintain market leadership position globally in enterprise AI. If we do that, I suspect this will be a pretty successful company and more successful than that. And we appreciate your time, courtesy and attention, and we look forward to staying in touch. Thank you all very much.\nOperator: That concludes the C3 AI Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you for your participation.

Thank you, Paul, and good afternoon, everyone. I am most pleased to provide you an update on our first quarter results and provide some comments on the state of the business as we see it. We posted another set of strong results in the first quarter. We continue to make great progress in solidifying our position as the pure play enterprise AI application software company. Our progress continues as planned on track. Our products are powering some of the world's largest enterprise AI application deployments as we expand our production footprint across industries and regions globally. Our first quarter performance was a strong start to the new fiscal year. Let's look at some of the financial and business highlights. Total revenue for the quarter was $52.4 million, up from $40.5 million a year ago, an increase of 29% year-over-year. Subscription revenue was $46.1 million, up from $35.7 million one year ago, an increase of 29% year-over-year. Non-GAAP gross profit was $40.9 million, a 78% gross margin compared to $30.2 million gross profit, a 75% gross margin a year earlier. This was an increase in gross margin of 35% year-over-year. Our remaining performance obligations or RPO was $290.6 million compared to $275.1 million a year ago, an increase of 6% year-over-year. Non-GAAP RPO was $357.3 million compared to $279.5 million a year ago, an increase of 28% year-over-year. We ended the quarter with 89 enterprise AI customers, an increase of 85% year-over-year. As we have previously discussed, historically, our business has been characterized by quarter-to-quarter lumpiness due to the substantial size of our average order value. Now as application sales become an increasingly large part of our revenue mix, roughly 50% of our subscriptions last quarter in Q1 accrued from application software. We are increasingly offering lower priced, high-value products like C3 AI CRM and Ex Machina. And as we've discussed, we've been diversifying our distribution model to complement enterprise selling with telesales, distributors, market partners and direct marketplace selling. While we have not yet fully eliminated the lumpiness from our business model, we have made great progress with average subscription total contract value shrinking from $16.2 million in fiscal year 2019 to $12.1 million in fiscal year 2020 to $7.2 million in fiscal year 2021 to $4.5 million in the quarter ended July 31. It's my expectation that this average contract value will continue to increase going forward as we continue to add diversity to both our product mix and our distribution model. Our average revenue per customer in the first quarter was $535,000. Let's talk about our market partner ecosystem. We significantly expanded this partner ecosystem in Q1 entering an important highly strategic alliance with Google Cloud to allow the entire Google Cloud global sales and service organization to co-sell and service the entire family of C3 AI applications globally. The two companies will tightly integrate C3 AI and Google Cloud technologies and go-to-market initiatives with the effect of accelerating enterprise AI adoption. The comprehensive alliance includes coordinated software development roadmaps, tight product integration as well as joint selling, joint marketing and joint customer success programs at global scale. C3 AI and Google Cloud will regularly synchronize our software engineering roadmaps and activities to ensure that the Google Cloud, Google Cloud applications and the C3 AI Suite and AI enterprise applications are fully optimized and tightly integrated. The companies will engage in significant ongoing marketing development activities and will coordinate sales and service activities globally to assist small, medium and large enterprise customers to accelerate the adoption and time to value of their enterprise cloud AI applications. We expect this partnership will dramatically accelerate the adoption of enterprise AI applications across all industry segments and will improve an additional growth engine for C3 AI. Microsoft, our partnership, our strategic partnership with Microsoft continues to expand. To-date, we have closed more than $200 million in business with Microsoft. Our joint teams are currently working a pipeline of more than $350 million in specific opportunities. Recent wins with Microsoft include the United States Missile Defense Agency, Cargill, Ball, Cummins, the United States Air Force Rapid Sustainment Office and we continue to make great strides in the market in Europe, in North America, in federal and it is a very, very important relationship. C3 AI CRM, we are seeing increased interest in the C3 AI CRM bandwidth applications that address the currently installed investments of CRM systems. And these investments are estimated to be well in excess of $500 billion. When you think about it, C3 CRM sales and software sales this year will be $120 billion, this year alone. So we put some number of years of investment. So Salesforce, Siebel, SAP, Dynamics, Accenture, PwC, Deloitte, et cetera, this is -- there's no way, you don't get to a number greater than $0.5 billion, so $0.5 trillion installed base. Now with C3 AI CRM, companies can easily upgrade their existing Salesforce deployments, their Dynamics deployments, Siebel deployments, ServiceNow, Viva, SAP CRM and retain those investments, but at the same time make them fully predictive, including now precise AI revenue forecasting, AI product forecasting, next best product, next best offer, customer retention and customer satisfaction management. As you can imagine, we are seeing really substantial interest from the largest integration partners that see this as an opportunity to upgrade and add additional services into their existing CRM installed base. And so you can expect from this to see additional market partner announcements in this area in the coming quarters. Customer momentum, we expanded our enterprise AI footprint in the first quarter in defense, in chemicals, in financial services, manufacturing, oil and gas, energy sustainability and utilities. We have new quite significant enterprise production deployments went live at LyondellBasell, Shell, ENGIE and Con Edison. We initiated new enterprise AI projects with Baker Hughes, Ball Corporation, Cargill, Cummins, ENGIE, FIS, Koch Industries, the Missile Defense Agency, Morsco, and Standard Chartered Bank and we significantly expanded business with Cargill, LyondellBasell and Standard Chartered Bank. In the course of the quarter, we continued to advance our product leadership position in enterprise AI. In the first quarter, we released two major upgrades to the C3 AI Suite and we have now released 40 enterprise AI software applications into production release for banking, for manufacturing, for telecommunications, public sector, energy, utilities, defense and intelligence. We also released a new version of C3 AI energy management, a solution that helps enterprise control and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and manage energy consumption and energy costs and we launched C3 AI Ex Machina our no-code AI and analytics platform that anyone can use and continue to deliver new features to enhance and simplify the user experience. We gave you know quite a bit of additional industry recognition in the course of the quarter. C3 AI was named the leader in the IDC MarketScape Worldwide for Industrial IoT Applications. The C3 IDC MarketScape positioned C3 AI as the leader for -- as an AI platform provider. Importantly, our customer at the Air Force Rapid Sustainment Office was selected as a finalist for the constellation supernova AI and data award. This is the highest honor in enterprise AI application excellence and this is an award that was won last year by C3 AI customer Shell for its C3 AI enterprise AI accomplishments in production use. We continue to grow our enterprise AI production application footprint through both new customer acquisitions and expanded use by existing customers. We had 101 discrete applications in production at the end of the first quarter, up from 67 a year earlier, operating at massive scale as of the end of the first quarter. The C3 AI Suite and Applications were integrated with roughly 850 unique enterprise and extraprise data sources. We are processing 1.7 billion predictions per day. We are managing 24 in excess of 24 trillion data elements and evaluating in excess of 33 billion machine learning features daily. We've been doing a lot of work, as you have seen in the media and online and brand awareness and we considerably extended our brand leadership for enterprise AI capturing both the number one and number two internet search positions for that category in the first quarter and we achieved in the next closest competitor by a factor of three to one. C3 AI Digital Transformation Institute, I want make a few comments about that important initiative. We continue to invest in our important University Partnerships at UC Berkeley, the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Princeton, MIT, Carnegie-Mellon, Stanford, the University of Chicago and KTH in Sweden with the C3 AI Digital Transformation Institute. In the first quarter we announced and funded $4.4 million of getting initial cash awards to support 21 groundbreaking research projects focusing and using the C3 platform and the developing new AI techniques to advance energy efficiency and lead the way to a lower carbon higher efficiency economy. We have been doing a lot of work really and focusing in leadership and sales leadership in the company. Importantly, with the addition of former VMware and SAP Executive Sam Alkharrat, as President and Chief Revenue Officer to lead the global expansion of C3 AI sales and customer service organizations. Sam is an experienced and proven sales executive with a long track record of building and managing highly effective sales and customer service teams. Sam previously served as a Senior Vice President and Global Head of Sales for VMware, Tanzu portfolio of applications that was roughly a billion dollar software business. And prior to VMware, Sam held a number of Senior Executive positions at SAP. With human capital, we continue to be just extraordinarily fortunate in the quality of human capital that we're able to track from leading universities added from other organizations globally. In the first quarter, believe it or not, we received just shy of 6,200, I'm sorry, 9,200 employment applications, okay. And from that I think we had interviewed 1,500 people and added 54 net new employees and people are as bright and experienced as they get. We ended the quarter with 628 full-time employees. And as you can see on the internet, C3 AI continues to be ranked amongst the best places in the world to work by Glassdoor. So, in summary, the enterprise AI application software market is rapidly growing. We see accelerating interest in our applications across industries, geographies and market segments. We are aggressively investing to extend our product and technology leadership to expand our market partner ecosystem and the associated distribution capacity that comes along with our ecosystem. As we continue to execute in delivering high-value outcomes for our customers, we are increasingly well positioned to establish a global leadership position in enterprise AI application software. Bottom line, our performance in the first quarter was strong across the board and we're planning for continued growth in this year and accelerating growth next year. Overall, I would say, the progress of the company is exactly on track with the plan that we laid out for you during before the IPO and during the IPO and as updated in the past two quarters. I believe the company has never been better positioned to achieve its objective of establishing a clear market leadership position in enterprise AI application software globally. I'll now turn this over to our CFO, David Barter for more color on the quarter. David?\nDavid Barter: Thank you, Tom. We delivered another strong performance in the first quarter with revenue and profitability that exceeded our guidance. We ended the quarter with a healthy contractual backlog. It provides us with meaningful revenue coverage and it supports our growth ambitions. Revenue was $52.4 million, an increase of 29% year-over-year. Subscription revenue was $46.1 million, an increase of 29% year-over-year. This level of growth represents a substantial increase from the fourth quarter and subscription revenue grew 17% year-over-year. Professional services revenue in Q1 was $6.3 million. Subscription revenue represented 88% of total revenue in the quarter. This is an increase of six percentage points from Q4. We continue to expect our mix of subscription revenue to trend in the high 80% range. Our revenue growth was highlighted by continued diversification and broad-based strength in our industry verticals. Five industry verticals each contributed over 10% of our revenue this quarter. This includes the financial services industry vertical, which grew 45% year-over-year. Geographically, our revenue diversification also improved. During the first quarter, revenue from customers in EMEA and APAC grew 37% year-over-year and represented over 30% of our revenue. From a backlog perspective, total remaining performance obligations were $290.6 million, up 6% year-over-year and current RPO, which we expect to recognize over the next 12 months was $145 million, an increase of 10% from a year ago. We ended the quarter with an additional $66.7 million in backlog from contracts with the cancellation right. When combined with our GAAP RPO, we ended the quarter with non-GAAP RPO of $357.3 million, an increase of 28% from a year ago. As I note in the last quarter our non-GAAP RPO does not include any backlog associated with Baker Hughes, that does not have an existing and customer contract. The Baker Hughes commitment at the end of the first quarter represented an additional $204.4 million of backlog. In the first quarter, total revenue from our partnership with Baker Hughes was $16.1 million, up 69% year-over-year. As a reminder, a portion of this revenue is reported as related party revenue where they end customer contracted directly with Baker Hughes or where the revenue relates to Baker Hughes as a customer. The total amount included in related party revenue was $12.3 million in the first quarter. Turning to expenses and profitability. I will be referring to non-GAAP metrics, which excludes stock-based compensation expense, and the employer portion of payroll tax expense related to stock transactions. A GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation is provided with our earnings press release. Gross margin in the first quarter was 78%, up 340 basis points from a year ago. The margin expansion reflects the strong growth of our subscriptions. Subscription gross margin in Q1 was 81.8%. This compares favorably to Q4 when margin was 80.7% and a year ago when it was 76.5%. The persistent margin expansion illustrates the leverage generated by our operating model. Operating expenses were $62.6 million compared to $31.1 million a year ago, reflecting planned strategic investments to drive our long-term growth. Operating loss was $21.8 million in the first quarter and better than our guidance of an operating loss of $28 million to $35 million. We continue to invest thoughtfully in headcount and programs to accelerate our revenue growth. Turning to our balance sheet and cash flows. We ended the quarter with $1.09 billion in cash, cash equivalents and investments. We generated positive operating cash flow of $1 million in the first quarter and with capital expenditures of $1 million, free cash flow was breakeven for the quarter. Deferred revenue grew to $99.9 million of a very healthy 33% from the fourth quarter. It's important to note that two deals closed in the first quarter, included a structure and billing terms that led to less deferred revenue than our typical year. All-in-all, Q1 nicely built on a very strong fourth quarter and supports our confidence for the remainder of the year. Turning to our guidance for the second quarter and full fiscal year. In Q2, we expect total revenue in the range of $56 million to $58 million, representing growth of 35% to 40% and an acceleration in top line growth from the first quarter and prior fiscal year. We anticipate subscription revenue mix will continue to trend in the high 80% range. We expect to make growth investments and anticipate a non-GAAP operating loss in the range of $30 million to $37 million. For full fiscal year 2022, we continue to expect revenue in the range of $243 million to $247 million, representing growth of 33% to 35% with the focus on making thoughtful growth oriented investments over the balance of the year. To accelerate our growth, we anticipate a non-GAAP operating loss in the range of $107 million to $119 million. In summary, we delivered first quarter results that were above our guidance coupled with healthy sales activity. We believe we are well positioned to meet the increasing demand for our technology from customers who realize significant economic benefits and deploying our solutions and remain optimistic about our ability to penetrate a very substantial opportunity over the long term. Thank you for joining today's call. Now I'll turn the call over to the operator for questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Michael Turits from KeyBanc. Your line is open.\nMichael Turits: Hey, guys. I wanted to ask you, Tom, about the diversification down market and to more of run rate business, but you discussed, sounds like you've made good progress on reducing the TCO and TCV, excuse me. Can you talk a little bit about what you're doing to get yourself there? Are you adding more people? You talked a little bit about partnerships and how much progress you're actually making with Ex Machina to get you there also?\nTom Siebel: Thank you, Michael. I think a lot of it is really, we're seeing -- we saw a dramatic increase. We're seeing increase in our application software versus platform as a component of our revenue mix and the applications sell for substantially less money easy than the platform does. So that's a big contributor. Ex Machina is making a positive contribution to it, but I really would expect to see that kick in the fourth quarter of this year and next year and getting into big numbers. But I think it's mostly a move towards applications. What is moving the needle on bringing the TCV down and it\u2019s come down substantially. Again a couple of years ago was $16 million average TCV and last quarter, it was $4.5 million. So we're making good progress.\nMichael Turits: Great. Thanks, Tom. And then, Dave, a couple of comments on the always fascinating RPO calculation. So RPO, the GAAP RPO just declined slightly sequentially. And if I add all the pieces together, the adjusted total did also. But the one that looked like it was up sequentially, was that cancelable piece, which I think it's mostly government. So can you talk about what the puts and takes on those different components of RPO?\nTom Siebel: Absolutely, Michael, and thank you for your question. You're right. When we think about structuring our deals, we do include that cancelable portion because it is a right and it\u2019s a piece of flexibility that with the literature gets carved out of GAAP. And so we find the GAAP RPO as an incomplete measure, which is why we provide you with a non-GAAP RPO, which increased 28%. In terms of the adjusted RPO, which includes the Baker Hughes component, you might remember that that's a five-year commitment. So when it first signed, you got the step-up and then it amortizes over time, which is why that is not increasing when you think about the adjusted RPO. So the non-GAAP RPO really is the measure you should look at because it's reflective of our commercial activity.\nMichael Turits: Right. And then the cancelable piece that, I'm sorry to interrupt, I did. This the cancelable piece, they went up really nicely sequentially from 51, it looks like up to 66, if I do the math. But is that expressive of some strong government contracts?\nTom Siebel: No. Those are - Michael. Hi, it's Tom. No, those are almost all- those are exclusively non-government. So the government contracts are always, by definition, kind of 12 months in duration, okay? Even if it's funded for multi-years, the part here irrevocable, nonrefundable is only 12 months at a time. So the cancelable deals are tend to be where we do three or four or five-year transactions with a large private sector corporation where if it's not going well after the first year, they have the right to cancel. And then so you can be certain that we have every incentive make sure that customers always satisfied at the end of the first year. And so there's almost no public sector I think.\nMichael Turits: Okay. Thanks, Tom. Thanks, David.\nTom Siebel: And Michael, you raised a great point. When we're signing multi-year federal contracts, that's over and above this number. So that's not recorded here at all. And so we actually do have quite a few of those where multi-year federal agreements and because the way that the GSA, those contracts were - we don\u2019t report that at all. So that would be on top of anything that we reported.\nMichael Turits: Got it. Thanks, Tom. Thanks, Dave.\nTom Siebel: Thanks, Michael. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nMark Murphy: Yes. Thank you very much, and I'll add my congrats. So Tom, I wanted to ask you about the Google Cloud relationship and just whether you're expecting that to appeal to a different type of customer because I think we're aware that the Google Cloud platform has a different architecture. It is more private cable larger pipes, they can absorb more traffic. There is more local points of presence. I'm just wondering if it gets a different need maybe certain verticals or machine learning models that are maybe a little more demanding in some ways?\nTom Siebel: Well this - Thomas Kurian has really changed the nature of Google Cloud in a big way as you're well aware. I think they've gone from maybe 400 salespeople of couple of years ago who are kind of middleware salespeople to quarter of 4,000 salespeople today and these are kind of experienced enterprise salesmen and women. Their focus is very much on the enterprise. I don't think it's that different. It's just Thomas has made a decision, a very concerted decision to approach the market in a different way. So rather than the other hyperscalers and rather than sell CPU seconds and storage hours, which - and they have an argument that I won't go into and I'm not really qualified. They argued successfully what they do is technically superior to other people, maybe it's too, I don't know, okay? But rather than compete based upon speeds and feeds, they have made a decision. They're going to compete based upon applications. So they're going to be selling stochastic optimization of the supply chain. They're going to be selling supply network risk. They'll be selling anti-money laundering, fraud detection, what have you and that's just how this is how they're positioning their company as a deliver of turnkey solutions and we're very fortunate that they decided to partner with us in that effort. Well, this gives them kind of a unique position in the hyperscale market, okay? We're in the hyperscale market where they're selling turnkey applications and everybody else is selling CPU seconds. Now the net result of these applications is when they're up and running, they do nothing but consume CPU seconds and storage hours. But it's a -- it's - I think we're seeing a changing dynamic in the hyperscale market that you might want to take a look at. I think that's what's going on.\nMark Murphy: Okay, understood. And then as a quick follow-up. There is a comment regarding the Microsoft relationship that you've closed deals worth over $200 million to date, obviously, a great accomplishment. And I was just wondering maybe David or Tom, you can clarify. Is that a specific reference to the CRM use case that's you mentioned with Dynamics and other systems? Or is that all of the C3 deployments of any product that are running on Azure? And if you could just clarify is that $200 million sitting in the RPO balance?\nTom Siebel: Some of it is - most of it is. First of all, it is not specifically CRM, Mark, okay? It really - all of our application support Azure, okay? Microsoft has been enormously supportive and where I can support to make sure we take full advantage of all the Azure resources. They are a great partner, a very small component of it is CRM and these are commercial applications, these are federal applications, supply chain, predictive maintenance, this is kind of bread and butter stuff, and most of it is sitting in RPO.\nMark Murphy: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Sanjit Singh from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nSanjit Singh: Thank you for taking the questions. Tom with this sort of shift towards an applications focused strategy versus kind of the C3.ai suite as the business shifts more towards application. What does imply in terms of future revenue growth, because if I look at the growth in your, in the number of applications is up really solidly I think 50% plus versus your RPO growth of in the high '20s. Does that mean that over time we should see RPO growth on sort of converge to the growth in sort of on the application sales that you're sort of seeing?\nTom Siebel: Okay. We're kind of keep there's kind of some analysts asked here that I can't quite keep up with. Okay, but let me so Sanjit first of all this, our emphasis on applications is not new. There is no change here at all, okay. So we've been selling. I mean you will recall during the IPO roadshow. I was leading with applications. Applications for utilities, oil and gas companies, manufacturing companies, financial services companies what have you. And so there's no change in emphasis. We sell both applications and we sell the platform and we kind of sell whatever the market wants this quarter and I wish I could give you guys some guidance, okay. Got to going forward, but we took a hard look at the data yesterday in anticipation of kind of this question of what we're going to expect to be applications versus platform in coming quarters and it's just jumps around sellings from quarter-to-quarter, that we can tell you that. But there is no change in emphasis and applications on our part, okay. We're always led with applications. There is certainly a change in the part of Google's part and it just happens to bode very well for us.\nSanjit Singh: Makes total sense, Tom. Maybe a follow-up question on the Google partnership. How should we think about that as the opportunities. Is this about going for net new customers or is there a certain percentage of the 80 or 98 enterprise customers that you have today that are Google Cloud customers. Any sort of sense of what the overlap is between C3 and Google within your current customer base?\nTom Siebel: Yeah, I would say, a relatively small, a very small segment of our existing customers are Google customers. Google, as you know, is number three in the market to AWS and Azure, but they are by far the most rapidly growing. And so and they're closing some very large accounts like Walmart and Deutsche Telekom and others and you can say from my perspective this is really a focus on -- this is a focus on net new customers for us. From them it's a focus on both net new customers and provide the customers the applications they want to consume the commitments they've made to Google.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brad Sills from Bank of America. Your line is open.\nAdam Bergere: This is Adam on for Brad. Congrats on the quarter too. So just on the eco partnership also can you guys share any expectations you have in terms of the constel. You mentioned that the focus is on net new just now, but within the I guess applications that you guys provide, do you expected to benefit more towards the applications or towards the suite or how should we be thinking about the benefits of the partnership?\nTom Siebel: We'll be leading, first of all, we've been working on this for the guy who runs sales at Google and the Rob Enslin and the person who runs sales here Sam Alkharrat are colleagues from SAP. So these guys know each other really well and we've been working on aligning of the sales organization across industries, across geographies and focusing on target strategic accounts. So this is pretty well orchestrated and we will most certainly be leading with applications, but where we're getting a large automotive companies or large financial service institutions you will want to license the platform. Absolutely and that will be available in Google's bag to sell it or will sure we sell it with them, but this is -- this might be an inflection point in the hyperscale market.\nAdam Bergere: And then just as a follow-up. Is there any commentary you can provide on some of the [indiscernible] you guys kind of called out financial services in the prepared remarks or the entire to call out?\nTom Siebel: I think we're having data on our distribution. Hold on Adam. I think I actually have this data right here. Just give me a second. It's pretty highly diverse. So well I can't share by percentages. Yeah, it's pretty highly diversified across telecommunications, high-tech life science, aerospace and defense, manufacturing, financial services, utilities, oil and gas. I don't see what the percentages are here, but it was something used to be 100% utilities, not too long ago, it's got a long way. What do I have here. Okay, so we are looking roughly 40% manufacturing, 7% aerospace, 3% utilities, 3% what it is -- 27% oil and gas, 22% high-tech and then we're just started making inroads now into life sciences, 7% aerospace. So that's what it looks like today.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of DJ Hynes from Canaccord. Your line is open.\nDJ Hynes: Tom, I want to ask about CRM. I mean the commentary this quarter seem to suggest an uptick in activity there, maybe even more interestingly on the SI partner side, can you just talk about what you're seeing with the CRM and I'm curious like is there any installed CRM platform that you're seeing particular traction with, any color there would be helpful?\nTom Siebel: Well the CRM installed base is quite large, okay and everybody wants to go predictive, okay. There's kind of two ways to do that, you guys doing the math, but it's not, it's no way can be less than $0.5 trillion market. And everybody wants to go into predictive and it had two ways to do it, you can rip and replace or you can add on top of it. So the way that our share on a product works it sits on top of dynamics, on top of sales for us, on top of Siebel, on top of SAP, on top of Viva, and it installs very quickly, it aggregate those data and then it allows you to aggregate any other data you want about the market, okay. And those data that you're going to aggregate are like three or four orders of magnitude more data you have a record in the CRM system econometric data, stock prices, NLP on news, NLP on social media, NLP on analyst reports, NLP on annual reports and financial statements. GDP growth rates, unemployment rates, commodity prices is just running through that industry may be some corn and beans as it relates to ag and there we have weather with rain or it's in oil and gas, it's going to be in transportation, travel and transportation maybe it's Jet A. But when we aggregate all of these data we can build very precise machine learning models that for revenue prediction, revenue forecasting, product forecasting customer churn and what have you. So we are seeing a lot of interest amongst the same partner ecosystem that we put in place that you might recall Siebel Systems, we know these guys pretty well. And they see this as an opportunity to upgrade all of their existing applications. So keep your eye on this space DJ. This is going to be a big business for us. And we're not going to be really I think what we're doing is entirely complementary to Salesforce, Dynamics, Siebel, SAP, and I guess the customers where they want to go quickly and it gives the systems and integrators an opportunity to generate business now in a way that provides and almost an value with their customers. You're going to see also that we have re-invaded and I'm not going to pre-announce it now, okay. But we have fundamentally reinvented, okay, the human computer interaction model as it relates to CRM. And when you see it, I think you'll be quite impressed. And I've been, we've been working on this and I personally have been working on this really hard. And it's, this is going to be a bigger business than I thought.\nDJ Hynes: Yeah, look forward to that, sounds interesting. David as a follow-up to you. Do you have a growth rate for current non-GAAP RPO?\nDavid Barter: I don't have a breakout of the current non-GAAP RPO.\nDJ Hynes: Okay. It seems like that cancelable backlog portion, which is by nature multi-year is increasingly contributing to non-GAAP RPO. So it would be helpful to get a view of that at some point. So thank you guys. I'll jump back in the queue.\nTom Siebel: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Patrick Colville from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Dan on for Patrick. Congrats on the quarter. You guys said earlier in response to a question that the average contract size is declining because you're selling more applications across the platform, and that makes lot of sense. I guess my question would be on that is I guess kind of two-part. One is, is that leading to more traction with smaller customers like actually smaller businesses or is it still primarily very large businesses that are buying enterprise apps or has there been any in that move toward the selling more applications that lead to any more deals kind of down-market at all. And then two I mean I guess can you kind of comment on, you said in response to another question, you mentioned that it's not going to change in strategy. So I wonder if you could comment kind of why you think you're seeing that shift? Thank you.\nTom Siebel: Where we're seeing what shift?\nUnidentified Analyst: Smaller customer. A shift toward I guess more application and less of the platform?\nTom Siebel: Well, that's what we lead with applications. I mean that's always the way, there is always the way the sales cycle begins. We're solving a business problem whether it's anti-money laundering, cash management, cash optimization, the supply chain, customer churn. All was solving a business problem lead with the application. And an application might sell list price for an application might be like $0.5 million a year. Now the - and then what happens is we get involved in a pilot and the other side they want one or two or three applications that they might license. I think our average contract. I think we've disclosed this is by a quarter of 36 months or something, okay, plus or minus something, okay. So then sometimes in the course of finding one or two or three applications they say they want to build 12 and then they license the platform also and they want to license the platform for 25 or 50 developers. So this is multiple years. So with that started out as a transaction that was going to be like a $1.5 million turns into $39. So this is how it happens. So we did let them happen at what, however, the customer wants to buy it. Now there is a customer list here someplace. And yes we are, yes, we are absolutely selling the smaller customers. There's no question about it. We used to only sell to companies like it wasn't rather that Shell, it wasn't Bank of America. We didn't call on them, okay. But here we have relatively small businesses by our standards would be places like Morsco, Ball, Spearstone, Skillion, CerebralEdge, ABC Dust. And so we're absolutely seeing that we're not, we used to be in the business of just elephant hunting, but now we're out elephant hunting and we're deer hunting and we're squirrel hunting and in a pretty big way at global scale.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jack Andrews from Needham. Your line is open.\nJack Andrews: Good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. Just in light of the Google announcement and just other relationships you have with companies like Microsoft and Snowflake. Could you just update us in terms of what type of technology vendors do you feel are natural allies for you versus maybe other types that you view as potentially more competitive?\nTom Siebel: Well natural allies would certainly be all the hyperscalers. Natural allies would be a lot of people who make componentry like Snowflake makes a platform-independent, storage system, and that's certainly complimentary us. I think companies like who make, we have products that compete with us like AI like auto ML. I mean we partner with H2O, we partner with Data Robot. I think as we partner with Data Robot and Shell and people to get to our auto ML or they can use their robots auto ML. Databricks many of our customers use Databricks. So we partner with them. So I think the component providers are individually potential partners. I don't do they look like distribution channels, no, Okay. I don't think they do. The, you know, the real competitor what we do are all those components in aggregate and Jack where the IT organization decides that they want to build this project themselves in one of these kind of multi-year multi-hundred million dollar science projects. All of which seem to come crashing down after a few years. And so, yeah, I guess the real competitors for CIO who wants to build him or herself and we just have to let that process run its course because it's virtually impossible, they're going to succeed at it and after they get through after the crash and burn like they have done virtually every one of our customers, then we come in and bail them out, it's just -- it's just a natural part of the process and we've got the new technology.\nJack Andrews: Thanks. I appreciate the context, and just as a quick follow-up, when we think about the cash on your balance sheet. I'm just curious, are you contemplating any sort of in technology-related M&A that could potentially accelerate when you're doing on the product development front or do you feel that it's still important to keep developing things internally?\nTom Siebel: It's a great question and make no mistake, we are focused on growing the business organically, okay. So if we don't see M&A as a big part of the equation might we buy something if we see that the easy piece of technology there that complements our technology stack that would make sense for us to own it because we see something really unique there. Yes, we might, okay. But M&A there is nobody here in charge of that, the default answer when the bankers send us the actual M&A as you can say no before we even read them and we're focused on growing the business organically because I think for us involved in M&A would really be a distraction. I think we stick to our knitting, okay. We continue to move the product footprint, continue to grow the customer base, continue to make our customers successful. I think everything is going to work out just fine.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Pat Walravens from JMP. Your line is open.\nPatrick Walravens: Great, thank you. I have one for Tom and one for David, if that's okay. Tom for you, first, what's the opportunity look like for C3 in Federal and Department of Defense and as I ask that question I realize but obviously you have to be careful what you say, but all you have to do go on the Department of Defense website and two weeks ago Vice Admiral was talking about the missile defense testing which you had some on your press release that looks similar. And in June the Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks had a big thing, where she is talking about the AI and data acceleration initiatives. So it seems like a lot of that is out there publicly already. So whatever you can say about what the opportunity looks like for C3 would be great?\nTom Siebel: It's staggering, Pat, okay. That's how big it is, it's endless. And you know just from you to me there is a really interesting book out there called The Kill Chain written by name Christian Brose. If you don't like it I will give you 19 bucks back from Amazon about kind of how the whole nature of warfare is changing between us and China and where AI fits into this, but you get to the level of the staff and all of the leaders of all these measures, all are thinking about is AI and how they're going to AI enable everything. So that is almost that is a business opportunity without balance. I wonder this is one of the reasons we brought General Ed Cardon in. Ed Cardon as the Chairman of Federal Systems. He formerly around the U.S. Cyber Command. And so he and so Paul Nakasone, who runs the NSA and the Cyber Command was his Deputy and so Paul knows all of these guys and that we do spend a lot of time in the Pentagon. And I think that to the extent that we have the opportunity to serve the United States government. We're privileged to do so. I think we're involved in about 12 projects today and know that we invest a lot of time there. We recently in addition to Ed Cardon, we brought on Todd Weber as the General Manager of C3 Federal. So we are expanding that business and we think that market is so big and scary. And actually the war is going on between United States and China in AI. If we lose that war, the story is not going to end well, and we think there's an opportunity for us to play a role in that. You had a question for David?\nPatrick Walravens: Yeah, thank you for that. And so, David, I think you know, like if you look at the stock in the aftermarket, now it's down 8%, and I think one thing that is confusing is last quarter you grew 26%, this quarter you grew 29%. So generally people like acceleration and then you just guided if I'm doing my math right, the 38% growth the midpoint for next quarter and usually people guide the deceleration then try to beat it, you guys are guiding to acceleration. So normally that would be well received, but the RPO and the billings are bouncing around so much that it's really confusing. So any clarity you can help provide for why revenue is accelerating and yet the bookings metrics this last quarter decelerated and why we should have confidence in that revenue acceleration I think would be really helpful?\nTom Siebel: There is still lumpiness in the bookings, Pat. This is Tom. We're still doing big deals. While we've got it, but not as big as they used to be, there is still lumpiness and the bottom line is we had some deals in Q1 and into Q2. And so there's still do I believe that we have mechanisms in place to get them lumpiness out of the bookings, I do, but there's still there.
