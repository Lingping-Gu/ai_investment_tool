As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations section of Airbnb's website following this call. I will now hand the call over to Elli Mertz, VP of Finance. Please go ahead.\nEllie Mertz: Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to Airbnb's third quarter of 2023 earnings call. Thank you for joining us today. On the call today, we have Airbnb's Co-Founder and CEO, Brian Chesky and our Chief Financial Officer, Dave Stephenson. Earlier today, we issued a shareholder letter with our financial results and commentary for our third quarter of 2023. These items were also posted on the Investor Relations section of Airbnb's website. During the call, we'll make brief opening remarks and then spend the remainder of time on Q&A. Before I turn it over to Brian, I would like to remind everyone that we'll be making forward-looking statements on this call that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described under forward-looking statements in our shareholder letter and in our most recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained on this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. You should be aware that these statements should be considered estimates only and are not a guarantee of future performance. Also during this call, we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures. We provided reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in the shareholder letter posted to our Investor Relations website. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP results. With that, I'd like to pass the call to Brian.\nBrian Chesky: All right. Well, thank you, Eli and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining. I'm excited to share results with you. Q3 was another strong quarter for Airbnb. We had over 113 million Nights and Experiences Booked. Revenue of $3.4 billion grew 18% year-over-year. Net income was $4.4 billion. Now this includes a onetime income tax benefit from the release of a valuation allowance of $2.8 billion. But even excluding this tax benefit, adjusted net income was $1.6 billion, our highest ever and represented an adjusted net income margin of 47%. And free cash flow for the quarter was $1.3 billion. In fact, on a trailing 12-month basis, our free cash flow was $4.2 billion which is also our highest ever. And because of our strong cash flow and balance sheet, we repurchased over $500 million of our stock. Now during the quarter, we saw a number of positive business highlights. First, we have added nearly 1 million active listings this year. Our supply grew 19% in Q3 compared to a year ago. We once again saw double-digit supply growth across all regions with the highest growth in regions with the highest demand. Urban and nonurban supply increased at nearly the same rate and we saw relatively similar supply growth among individual professional hosts with the majority of new listings exclusive to Airbnb. Second, Q3 was a record travel season on Airbnb. Nights and Experiences Booked grew 14% in Q3 compared to a year ago. We saw an acceleration of nights growth across all geographies and we are particularly encouraged by the growth of first-time bookers during Q3 and we saw more nights than ever booked in the Airbnb app with 53% of gross nights booked in the app compared to 48% in the same period last year. And finally, international expansion markets are gaining momentum. Cross-border nights book increased 17% in Q3 compared to a year ago. In Asia Pacific, our business has fully recovered to pre-pandemic level. And we're seeing significant growth in Asia Pacific markets such as Taiwan, Thailand and Indonesia, all experiencing year-over-year nights growth above 30% on an origin basis. Now we've been able to achieve these results by continually making progress on our 3 strategic priorities. First, we're making hosting mainstream. We've been focused on making hosting as popular as traveling and our Q3 results show that our approach is working. We ended the quarter with the highest number of active listing and we saw strong active listings growth across all regions of the market types. And hosts are benefiting. During Q3 alone, Airbnb host earned more than $19 billion. We'll continue growing supply by raising awareness around hosting, making it easier to get started and improving the overall experience for a host. Second, we're reflecting our core service. We've collected millions of pieces of feedback on how to improve Airbnb. And 2 years ago, we started doing twice a year of product releases to address this feedback. And since then, we've launched more than 350 new features and upgrades across our entire service. And in the past year alone, this has included things such as improved customer service, total price display and new tools to help host set more competitive prices. These upgrades are paying off for both guests and host. For example, we redesigned our tool and we made it easier for hosts to add discounts and promotions. And now almost 2/3 the host offer weekly or monthly discount. We also added a new feature called similar listings that let hosts see listing prices in the area, so they know what to charge. And since we launched the similar-listings tool, nearly 1 million hosts have used this feature. In mid-September, we shared progress we've made to help lower cleaning fees, reduce prices and improved search and reliability. We have even more improvements coming as part of our November 8 winter release next Wednesday where we'll introduce dozens of new features aimed at making Airbnb more reliable. And finally, our third strategic priority is expand Airbnb beyond their core. Now we made significant progress in the past few years in building a strong and profitable business. And in addition to laying the foundation for new services and offerings, we've been focused on international expansion. We are investing in underpenetrated international markets and we're seeing great results. Following the success, we've seen in recent quarters in Germany and Brazil, Korea has now become one of our fastest growing countries compared to 2019 with gross nights booked 54% higher than they were in Q3 2019 on origin basis. As international travel continues to recover, we're building greater momentum for Airbnb in underpenetrated markets. So those are results for Q3. With that, Dave and I look forward to answering your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Mark Mahaney at Evercore ISI.\nMark Mahaney: And I have 2 questions. You talked about some of these improvements you've seen in markets like Germany, Brazil and Korea. Could you just spend a little bit more time on that opportunity going forward? And is it the expectation now that Germany and Brazil are already optimized, you just keep optimizing other ones? Or is this take a while to add to monetize those? And then secondly, in terms of future services that you could offer to sellers, any update on when we could see those particularly things like sponsored listings for sellers for host, I mean.\nBrian Chesky: Yes. Mark, this is Brian. I'll take it. Let's first talk about international expansion. So it's a great question. And as everyone on this recall is probably aware, Airbnb is in 220 countries in the region. So on the one hand, we're one of the most global like companies in all of travel. We're a truly global travel network. At the same time, Mark, what we've seen is that our penetration in the United States is significantly higher than our penetration in many other countries. And we think there's a huge amount of growth if we could just get Airbnb to even a fraction of the percentage of penetration that we have in the United States. So last year, we decided to roll out this updated playbook. We rolled it out in Germany and Brazil. It's kind of a four-pronged approach and involve some product optimization, PR, local marketing and just general optimizations on the ground in these regions. And what we've seen is Brazil is now double the size as it was pre-pandemic. We rolled that same playbook out to Korea. It's now 54% higher than it was before. But what I would say is we've just scratched the surface of what we can do in Germany, Brazil and Korea. I think those markets are on a good trajectory. They could be significantly larger and we're now looking at Japan and India, China, around Asia Pacific. We have some optimizations in Southeast Asia, continual growth in Mexico. There's a number of other countries in addition to a number of areas in Europe where we think we can see a lot more growth. So I think the next 24 months, we're going to see a major acceleration in our penetration in a lot of these markets. There's about a dozen, dozen half markets around the world, as you know, have large tourism opportunities and we're really focused on that. And that's going to be one of our biggest near-term expansion opportunities. With regards to future services to sellers, we don't have anything to announce right now. But what we've been doing is we've been building the foundation of our systems so that we can have these new tools and services, including sponsor listings. And we also -- recently, we've been rolling out a pilot for co-hosting. Co-hosting is a service where we match host that don't have homes but they have extra time with homeowners to have space but they don't have time to host. And we've been doing these pilots in France. We've rolled that out in parts of the United States and this is turning into a popular service that we think can unlock a lot more supply. So we're going to -- over the next couple of years, I think you're going to see a number of new services roll out for host.\nOperator: We'll go next to Eric Sheridan at Goldman Sachs.\nEric Sheridan: I just have one. Brian, in a number of interviews in the quarter, you talked about potential for product road map over the longer term, different products that could probably expand elements of the platform, car rentals, maybe even long-term apartment rentals. How do you think about product evolution that's being offered to the consumers on the platform and thinking about investing behind those initiatives?\nBrian Chesky: Eric, I mean, just to step back, the last few years, I think we've really, really benefited by being focused. When the pandemic occurred, we felt like we had to hunker down, get really lean, get really focused and we went from basically a breakeven company to now a company doing obviously cash flow margins of around 44% of revenue. So we've really benefited from this focus and really benefited from focusing on our core business. To your point, Eric, I think we are now getting ready to re-expand Airbnb beyond its core. It was always our attention to do much more than just short-term housing for travelers. We're always intended to do more of that. So we're working on making Airbnb more of an extensible platform. And I think, ultimately, there are actually quite literally dozens of services, guests and hosts that we could build on top of the Airbnb system. I think a lot of it comes down to making the platform extensible so we can offer these services. I think at the end of the day, we're really thinking about are a couple of big ideas. First, I think that we are thinking about generative AI as an opportunity to reimagine much of our product category and product catalog. So if you think about how you can sell a lot of different types of products and new offerings, generative AI could be really, really powerful. It can match you in a way you've never seen before. So imagine Airbnb being almost like the ultimate travel agent as an app. We think this can unlock opportunities that we've never seen. Additionally to that, there's a lot of opportunities on both the guests side and the host side. And so we're going to be thinking through a lot of this. So you'll see hopefully some updates in the coming years.\nOperator: We'll move to our next question from Brian Nowak at Morgan Stanley.\nBrian Nowak: I have two. First one, maybe on the guide a little bit. I know there's a lot of moving pieces between the revenue comments and the ADR comments and the take rate. Just sort of wanted to confirm, are you guys sort of looking to guide room night growth in sort of the high single, low double-digit range in 4Q? Is that the right way we should be thinking about with take rate and things? And then the second one, Brian, I know you, you have a lot of innovation, you have 350 features and upgrades, etcetera. Can you just sort of give us 1 or 2 of them that you think could be most impactful to accelerate that room night growth as we go into '24 and '25?\nBrian Chesky: And Brian, sorry, are you referring to things we've already shipped or things that we're working on that we haven't shipped?\nBrian Nowak: Well, either way you want to go. Yes, if you have one that already shipped that would be great. If you have other ones you want to tell us about next week, that would be good too.\nBrian Chesky: Yes. So yes, so let me -- why don't I answer the innovation and Dave, you can talk about the guide for going forward? So maybe let me talk about some things that we've already done. I can give you a little bit of sense of how we're thinking about next week and beyond. So we did over 50 upgrades last May. It was based on the idea that millions of customers have given us feedback, actually both guests and hosts on how to improve Airbnb and we've listened. And if I were to just call out 3 things, Brian, I would just call out 3 things would be total price display, pricing tools for host and monthly stays. So let me just go through 3 and what happened. On total price display, we rolled out total price display before taxes. This is based on popular demand. We are now the only travel app of our kind that actually does this. Since we rolled this out, 260,000 listings have removed or reduced their cleaning fees. We now have 3 million listings that do not have a cleaning fee. So we think this is working. We also think people are now being steered towards better total value on a total price, inclusive of overall cost basis. The second are pricing tools. Since we rolled out new pricing tools, about half of new listings are now offering a monthly discount. And we also have this new tool called similar listings, where you can see where other people are charging around you. And this we find has been the best way to make sure our host have competitive prices. Because host are usually surprised to discover the listings that get most bookings around them offer a better value. And it's always really hard to know what your home is worth and what you charge. And so the best thing you can do is give people transparent data. Well, 1 million people have used these tools and probably the thing I'd point to is, while this time year-over-year in September data, hotel prices are up 10%. Airbnb prices globally are only up 1%. So we are definitely moving in the right direction. Now in North America, on a mix shift in FX neutral basis, our price is actually down 3% in North America, while hotels are up towards double digits, I think. So the last thing I'd say is monthly stays. We obviously announced a bunch of updates on monthly stays, including you can pay by bank, we lowered fees after 3 months, we have the whole new really cool interface and stays for 3 months or longer are now growing nearly 20% year-over-year. So those are just 3 things we've seen. I think what we've learned is like as we listen to customers, we adapt quickly, we can drive incremental growth. As far as what's next, obviously, we don't talk about too much before it will release. I will say though, next Wednesday, we are focused on some pretty big opportunities around reliability. So this is the last thing I'll say about this. If you think about how big Airbnb is, for every person who stays in Airbnb, approximately 9 people every night stay in a hotel or about 9 bookings. The hotels are about to order magnitude bigger. And when you ask people, why do you book a hotel and not Airbnb, the number one reason they come up with is usually reliability that they know what they're going to get before they book. It kind of speaks to the strength and weakness of Airbnb that on the one hand, it's one of a kind, other hand, that one-of-a-kindness offers valuability that not every person wants. And so next week, we're going to have some new offerings that I think will make a pretty big in this. So that's what I can say. I think I'm pretty optimistic about what you'll see next week. And of course, we're already working on stuff for next May and next October releases as well. So hopefully, stay tuned.\nDavid Stephenson: And then in terms of the guidance, Brian, for the fourth quarter, we have our revenue guidance between $2.13 billion and $2.17 billion. So that's revenue growth between 12% and 14%. And remember that in Q3, our revenue growth, excluding the impact of foreign exchange is about 14%. So -- and we're not anticipating the same level of FX impact on the fourth quarter. So broadly, our revenue growth is relatively comparable between Q4 and Q3. In terms of the nights guide, we're just seeing some variability in our nights demand here early in the quarter and so we're just being cautious with that guide. And so we're not being specific on it but anticipate nights to be a few points below -- nights growth to be a few points below Q3.\nOperator: We'll move to our next question from Lee Horowitz at Deutsche Bank.\nLee Horowitz: Can you maybe help us think about how you guys are tracking towards expectations on occupancy or utilization moving forward? As you guys extend beyond the core into newer markets, do those markets come with occupancy or utilization headwinds that we should be thinking about? And holistically, how you guys think about how occupancy or utilization may track next year? And then, maybe just one high level one. Sticking beyond the current cycle, we've seen a lot of other remote travel models, sort of hit this low teens to high single-digit growth rate and decelerate from there or not be able to reaccelerate their business as a meaningful like. Can you maybe take a step back and help us better understand how you think that maybe Airbnb may be a little bit different than prior ratios that we've seen and could perhaps sustain sort of that double-digit revenue cadence over a longer period of time than what we're used to in the market.\nBrian Chesky: Yes. Yes, you start with occupancy and I'll take the second question.\nDavid Stephenson: In terms of occupancy, we've actually seen it be pretty stable in terms of kind of on a global basis. I mean, if you actually step back, you got to remember that the vast majority of our hosts on Airbnb are individual houses. They're not looking to drive 100% occupancy of all their listings. And what they want to do is earn enough money to usually hit some certain amount of financial goals. So as we continue to grow our inventory, we're continuing to see strong occupancy levels overall. Clearly, we grew our inventory at 19% which is ahead of kind of revenue growth in the current period. But if you actually step back and look over like a 4-year period, go back all the way to 2019, the growth in our overall listings have actually been relatively similar to our overall growth in night. So that occupancy over an extended time period tends to be fairly stable while in any short-term time period, it can have a little bit more volatility. But overall, again, we don't focus on occupancy as a primary driver, we monitor it on local by local because what really matters is that we have great available listings in a specific market on a specific date.\nBrian Chesky: Lee, I'll take your second question. Yes, I think that -- as I said before, I think we're only scratching the surface to how this company becomes. And I absolutely think that we can get to really solid double-digit revenue growth for many, many years to come. And there's 3 things that I'd point out. The first is our core business. I think our core business could be significantly larger than it is today, even if we didn't do anything new. And the reason I believe this is the following: I believe that almost every single person who stays in a hotel could stay in Airbnb is, number one, they knew about all the benefits of Airbnb and number two, we made sure that our service was sufficiently reliable to be an alternative. So let me start with those 2. We've done recently a new marketing campaign that's called \"Airbnb it\". And it basically contrast the benefits of the Airbnb versus the hotel. And based on our research, one of the things we've noticed is that a lot of people stay in hotels don't understand some of the unique benefits of staying in Airbnb and why it is better for certain types of trips. And one type of trip that Airbnb is almost always better is when you're traveling with 3 or more people. If you're traveling with a family or traveling with a group, why do you want to stay in different rooms versus -- different room separated. We're having to stay at the same time. And then the only place you can meet in these crowded lobbies when you can get a whole home all to yourself. So this is -- we've been running these digital campaigns. It's the highest performing digital campaign we've ever done. And this is going to be the basis for a new -- major new marketing campaign next year. Additional to that, as I mentioned before, if we just keep focusing on reliability, making sure that when you book, you know what you're going to get and this is ever a problem, you have an excellent customer service that is nearly as good as a front desk or as good as a front desk then I think there could be in the years to come a tipping point where many people could choose Airbnb. So that's just our core business. Next is international. Even though we're in 220 countries in the region, there's only a couple of countries where we even have penetration at rivals of United States. And those countries are Canada, Australia and France. After that, U.K. a little bit, it really starts to tip down. And so we have like massive, massive opportunity and just by bringing Airbnb's playbook to these other countries. Obviously, Germany but not just Germany, like actually the entirety of Northern Europe, Eastern Europe and even Italy and Spain, basically every country but France and U.K., there are at a step change lower penetration. Latin America is a completely new market for us, emerging. Asia Pacific, I would argue it's a completely new market. We can be adding huge amounts of growth just by our expansion playbook. And then finally, yes, I mean I would say just on new products and services, though we're not disclosing anything that we're doing new right now, here's what I'd say. I think the biggest strength I have as a CEO is not driving profitability even though we've done a really good job. I think it is literally inventing new products and services. That's why we've hired so many great technologists, designers and I think this is going to be a sweet spot for us. We're obviously not going to talk about new things before we ship them but twice a year, every May and every November -- October, November, we're going to be hopefully, putting out going forward new ideas that I hope really increase the addressable market for Airbnb. And I think that we can do much more than just short-term housing. But again, I think short-term housing is still a huge opportunity for us.\nOperator: We'll go to our next question from Doug Anmuth at JPMorgan.\nDouglas Anmuth: First, you caught up the greater volatility in early 4Q. Just curious if you have any view of whether that's more macro driven or geopolitical and then curious if you have a sense of kind of visibility and any kind of bookings into 2024 and perhaps maybe how that visibility compares now versus a year ago?\nDavid Stephenson: Yes. It's hard to completely pin down the root cause of any kind of softness or volatility. I think it is just broadly, what we're seeing is a little bit of softness in our overall kind of demand relative to Q3, we call out kind of the macroeconomic and geopolitical just because that is what's, I think, driving any volatility that's out there. It's early. I think I am clearly confident about our revenue growth for Q4 being 12% to 14% growth. And the fact that, that remains stable with Q3, I think is really promising. Our early visibility into 2024 is -- again, it's too early to tell. I think I'm feeling great about our overall playbook and plans, as kind of Brian has mentioned. I think I am most excited about the additional efforts we're making to get greater penetration in our international markets. And overall, I'm seeing solid demand for Airbnbs, like people are still prioritizing travel over buying things so I'm very bullish in the long term.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Jed Kelly at Oppenheimer & Company.\nJed Kelly: Okay, great. Can you just give us further update on the regulations you talked about in the shareholder letter. And then Google announced a new update to their vacation rentals where they're essentially letting property managers show their price. So can you talk about how you're seeing some of the changes Google is making.\nBrian Chesky: Jed, I'll take regulation. So yes, I would generally say, over the last decade, we've been really, really encouraged by the general trajectory of regulation. Here are a couple of stats. Currently today, 80% of our top 200 markets already have regulations on the books and these regulations, though they vary, generally have found workable solutions for home sharing for us to continue to grow and thrive. And I'd point out like the country of France has passed national legislation that is very, very favorable and workable. We've had cities near us like Seattle or San Diego that have passed really favorable legislation. I will probably contrast that to New York City which has completely gone a different direction. And unfortunately, I thought when we started Airbnb, we can develop model legislation in New York that we can make in New York, we can make it anywhere and that other cities have adopted legislation that New York has adopted. It turns out that's actually not the case. In fact, New York has gone a different direction and I think it's going to turn into a cautionary tale because what we're already seeing hotel price in New York are now up 8% year-over-year. A one-bedroom or a studio in New York seems to be about $500. A lot of people can't even afford to go there anymore. We are seeing work bookings in Jersey City and the perimeters around New York City. And I do anticipate more and more activity will probably go underground which is probably not the intention of the people to even pass a lot. So generally speaking, we're seeing the trend line to be generally really, really constructive. We built the city portal with the one-stop shop for cities to be able to self-serve, to be ale get data and monitor the type of activity happening in their city. We have 400 cities on the city portal. And generally, what we're seeing is that a lot of cities in pandemic or post-pandemic era have reached out to us wanting to make sure that they are able to benefit from economic dollars going to the city and we paid $9 billion in hotel tax. So generally, it's gone fairly well. It is going to be notable that if you just read the news, you're always going to seem to be reading about these cities, something happen in New York because we're in a 100,000 cities and nearly all regulations happen at the municipal level. So it's kind of a long slide to be able to work with these cities because there's so many of them and there's not a lot of standardization but generally speaking, now listed in New York, we are seeing a lot of positive developments. And then, on the Google question.\nDavid Stephenson: Yes, I can take this. I mean we're not going to respond directly to any kind of specific thing that Google is doing. I think if you do step back though and remember that the vast majority of host on Airbnb or individual host, approximately 90% of them, that the majority of those listings are unique to Airbnb and you can only get them here. I think that, that is one of the larger kind of defensible moats that we have which is if you want to have an amazing stay, if you want to have the unique listings, you come directly to us and we're really not seeing the impact of the competition taking additional share from us. In fact, we continue to take or increase our relative share of listings in the market, continually. And this is why we're continuing to grow at faster than the overall kind of travel market. So I don't have much more to say beyond that.\nBrian Chesky: Yes. Maybe the only other thing I'd say -- maybe the only other thing Jed, I'd say is we're just seeing a lot of strength in mobile bookings. You can think of mobile bookings essentially like direct. It's not people not going to Google. 53% of our gross nights booked in the last quarter were on native mobile apps, essentially iOS and Android. And that is up from a year earlier which was less than 50%. And again, I'll just say 90% of our traffic is direct or unpaid. So we think that the strength of our brand, the strength of our app, the strength of people coming direct to Airbnb is key. And the reason it's direct is because they're inventory is unique. It's not commodities. The majority of hosts don't list anywhere else and we build customer tools for them. So that's our general theory, to build unique inventories that allow people to come direct to Airbnb. And I don't see that changing.\nOperator: We'll move next to Nick Jones at JMP Securities.\nNick Jones: Great. Brian, you talked about Airbnb's pricing, maybe not increasing or it's down while hotels are up. I mean, how do you feel about the average prices on Airbnb today? Is there still room to kind of -- if you get those lower? And I guess as you talk about some of the marketing and advertising campaigns, do you think kind of travelers or consumers view Airbnb as a premium offering, a discount offering, is the reliability kind of the trade-off. I guess can you kind of maybe paint the picture a little bit more as to kind of what you feel consumers' hesitation is to maybe book an Airbnb and how much pricing plays a role in that?\nBrian Chesky: Nick, let me start with pricing and then I'll talk about the general offering. When we started Airbnb, our original tagline was a cheap affordable alternative to a hotel. And the primary reason people chose Airbnb the early days was price. Now once they used it, we used to say money as the hook but the experience is the reason you keep coming back. Because it also turns out when you stay in Airbnbs, you're often typically in a real neighborhood, not a hotel district. You have this really cool space. You can make a meal, you have a lot more of a much more quick home. Sometimes there's a local connection to the community, that's what you're looking for. But affordability has always been one of the most important benefits that we have in Airbnb. And I do feel like we still have opportunity for our prices to be even more competitive. There's a really interesting thing we discovered. Within reason, generally, when host lower the prices, they tend to make more money. And this is typically not true of hotels, right? Because if you're running at 80% occupancy and you lower your prices per night, you typically don't have a lot more room to make up the lower prices with higher occupancy and you'll typically lose money. But many of our hosts run at low enough occupancy and they always have that if they lower the price just a bit, they can sell more nights. And so we think there's a win-win where if we continue to encourage host to offer more competitive pricing, it's a win for guests but it's also a win for many of the host. And I would also just point out that in addition to pricing tools, you need to have ample supply. Supply, I just want to highlight again, is growing 19% year-over-year. This was a huge question by the way 18 months ago. Could Airbnb re-accelerate to nearly 20% supply growth and we are approaching 20% supply growth. I think that is really, really key. So to answer your question, we've made huge progress in last year but prices are up quite significantly from pre-pandemic for Airbnb and hotels. We're both up a lot. And my hope is whether or not prices come down on Airbnb further in the next year or 2, my hope is while hotels will almost undoubtedly keep increasing year-over-year, our prices will continue to be a little bit more -- they'll be more moderated. And that goes to the next question. We actually think there's a very high correlation of relationship between ADR and night growth and the higher the ADR, typically the lower the nights growth and the lower the ADR, typically the higher the nights growth. So there's a trade-off there. And so we think that as we continue to be more affordable, we'll continue to stimulate more demand. Now the interesting thing about Airbnb is that we're not really one type of offering, right? Southwest is a budget brand. Louis Vuitton is a luxury brand. Apple is kind of like a luxury brand for like a lot of different people but they do have like premium prices. Airbnb's offering really is one of the most unique and resilient models. I mean we are one of the most popular brands for people under 30 in travel, probably the most popular band for people under 30. We're also very much a family travel brand because homes accommodate families much better than typically hotels. We're not just an urban brand. We're a rural brand and vocational brand. We're not just a North American brand. We're a global brand. So one of the things we highlighted in the public is that we literally have something for everyone. But as we continue to get more affordable, I think that's going to continue to drive a lot more growth for us.\nOperator: And next, we'll go to Ron Josey at Citi.\nRon Josey: Great. Brian, I wanted to ask a little bit about your comments on first-time bookers. I'm just trying to understand a little bit more on the drivers that are attracting these new bookers. Are they doing this directly through the brand, Airbnb, through the app and just trying to understand a little bit more as you're expanding the pie and getting more supply and how users are coming to the site, point number one. And second question, just on probably with Experiences, there's any update there?\nBrian Chesky: Yes. I mean, David can feel free to jump in on this. But at the highest level, we generally are seeing that the vast majority of first-time bookers still come direct to Airbnb. So I'll just kind of step back. The number one way reason people come to Airbnb is because a friend or a family member told them about Airbnb. And so we primarily grow through word of mouth. After that, then we have a lot of earned media. We have some 500,000 to 600,000 press articles a year. I mean the share of voice of Airbnb compared to most travel companies is overwhelming. We have a greater share of voice than almost all the other major travel brands combined. We also have a huge amount of presence in social media. You might have heard a few months ago about the Barbie house rented in Airbnb or the Shrek House, so we get a lot of earned media. And then beyond that, we do these pretty big brand campaign. And the vast majority of our marketing spend that we do spend on advertising is not performance marketing, it's brand marketing. It's really marketing education around our unique product offering. So we do performance marketing but we think unlike other travel companies, it's not necessarily a way to buy customers. It's literally more like a laser that we use to hone in on balancing supply/demand and we really can use it to optimize certain markets. So a lot of it remains direct. And again, 90% of our traffic is direct or unpaid. I think that's been pretty consistent. On Experiences, again, I don't have anything new to share now. I'll just say the following. We are actively working on updates to this product. As much as people love homes, I think 84% of people who book Airbnb leave a review, give a 5 star. We even have a higher customer satisfaction experience with 94% of people leave 5-star reviews. So we haven't updated this product yet because we just had our hands full really trying to focusing the most perishable opportunities which was recovering from the pandemic, improving our core service and addressing the needs of customers. But we should have some updates coming in the coming -- obviously, coming next year and beyond on this product. And you'll see we're continually investing in this product.\nOperator: We'll go next to Kevin Kopelman at TD Cowen.\nKevin Kopelman: Could you touch on your vision for building more of a travel community on Airbnb and maybe the time line you expect for rolling out some of the new community features that you've talked about a little bit.\nBrian Chesky: Kevin, yes, I think -- let me just explain what I even mean by a travel community. I think one of the biggest visions that we have as a company isn't just to be a marketplace to become but to build literally quite literally a global travel community where you can get homes and experiences and a variety of other services, all in one place. So we can provide a lot of offerings for guests and hosts. And that we can use an emerging technologies like generative AI, like take the Where the Airbnb app can be like the ultimate travel agent. So to do this, there's a number of things that we've been investing in. The first thing is identity and account structure. So on most travel companies, you can book as a guest and they don't even have account information. And you can sign up with an account but you can also check out as a guest and they don't have the same robust account information that we do. On Airbnb 100% of the bookers and 100% of the host have to have a verified ID on -- associated to their account. They have robust profiles. About 70% of people on the guest and host side leave reviews to the other people. So this really does demonstrate how Airbnb is a little bit of a different community. We think that if we continue to invest in the profile and we can continue to invest in our system of trust, then as we learn more about guest and host, we can then match them for more types of offerings on Airbnb. And so this is, I think, really what we're starting to see. And the reason that AI is so powerful is I'll just cover 2 opportunities. Number one, I think that AI is going to affect -- this is an obvious statement, I think, digital business is more than brick-and-mortar businesses. So Airbnb and OTAs are probably going to benefit more quickly from AI than, say, a hotel will just because Airbnb and OTAs are more digital. And so the transformation will happen at the digital surface sooner. One of the areas that we're specifically going to benefit is customer service. Right now, customer service in Airbnb is really, really hard, especially compared to hotels. The problem is, imagine you have a Japanese host booking with -- hosting a German guest and there's a problem and you have these 2 people speaking different languages calling customer service, there's a myriad of issues, there's no front desk, we can't go on-premise. We don't understand the inventory and we need to try to adjudicate an issue based on 70 different policies that can be up to 100 pages long. AI can literally start to solve these problems where agents can supervise a model that can -- in second, come up with a better resolution and provide front desk level support in nearly every community in the world. But probably more importantly, Kevin, is what we can do by reimagining the search experience. Travel search has not really changed much in 25 years since really Expedia, Hotels.com, it's pretty much the same as it's been. And Airbnb, we fit that paradigm. There's a search box, you enter a date location, you refine your results and you book something. And it really hasn't changed much for a couple of decades. I think now with AI, there can be entirely different booking models. And I think this is like a Cambrian moment for like the Internet or mobile for travel where suddenly an app could actually learn more about you. They could ask you questions and they could offer you a significantly greater personalized service. Before the Internet, there were travel agents and they actually used to learn about you. And then travel got unbundled, it became self-service and it became all about price. But we do think that there's a way that travel could change and AI could lead the way with that. So these are some of the things we're thinking about and I think it's really, really exciting. And we're just at the beginning of this.\nOperator: We'll move next to Justin Post at Bank of America.\nJustin Post: Supply is up 19%. How do you think about that as a leading indicator for room night growth? And how do you maybe accelerate night growth to capture that? And then the second question is on ADRs. Is that supply coming in higher or lower, similar ADRs? And I don't know, Dave, if you can give us any thoughts on positive and negative drivers for ADRs next year.\nDavid Stephenson: Sure. Yes, I'll start with ADR and I'll go back to growth. I mean on the ADR side, it varies a little bit by market. We have seen, depending on the market, the ADRs of new listings coming in a little bit higher than they were in the average current ones. But what actually ends up happening is people are booking lower ADR places. And so that's kind of the offset. It depends on what's available and versus what's booked. And it does vary a little bit by region between North America and Europe on what the prices are. In North America, we're seeing more of the prices come down. And I think that's been a good indicator of strength for us going forward. And in Europe, the ADRs have been a little bit more elevated and we're hoping that with some more of the work that we've done to improve post tools and give greater visibility to host on how they're pricing, we'll continue to be able to kind of moderate ADRs in Europe going forward, too. So that's on the leading indicator. I do think that the strength of 19% listings growth is a great leading indicator of what we're capable of growing over time. As I said earlier, the overall growth of Airbnb since 2019, nights growth has been actually relatively in line with the total growth of supply. And I'm really bullish that we can get more supply coming on which will have more quality supply coming in which will also can drive down actually the prices because the more supply that comes on board, maybe back to your first question, the more likelihood that we can actually bring prices down in the market or at least moderate them so they don't grow as fast as competing supply. So, I'm really bullish on our overall growth. It's been great to see the strength of our listings growth this year.\nBrian Chesky: And maybe, Justin, I'll just say that like this is my intuition having done this for almost 16 years of my life. I think that supply is even more important than it seems on the surface. Ultimately, when you're tiny and no one ever hears about you, one of the big levers is awareness. But once you're a brand like Airbnb that's known as really [indiscernible] used all over the world, so supply growth becomes a very important like long-term leading indicator. And so long as we make sure we have healthy supply growth and then we continue to improve reliability and promote Airbnb globally around the world, then that is a very, very healthy long-term indicator. And we love for that number to be a bit higher.\nOperator: We'll go next to James Lee at Mizuho.\nJames Lee: Great. Two questions here, Dave. I remember at the beginning of the year when you were guiding ADR down about mid-single digits. You were talking about leverage and like variable expenses like payment and cloud. I was just wondering where you are in that process, how much up to unlock going forward? And secondarily, on sales and marketing, it looks like supply is creating demand right now. Is it fair to assume we're shifting more demand-side advertising going forward? And can you talk about the implications there?\nDavid Stephenson: I'll start with sales and marketing. We're not actually shifting more to demand-side marketing. I think what we're seeing is exactly the success that Brian talked about earlier on the call. We -- the vast majority of our traffic is direct or unpaid. The first reason why people come to Airbnb is they're referred to us by family and friends. They come directly to us. The brand marketing certainly kind of helps talk about all the features and benefits of Airbnb and we use our search engine marketing as kind of a laser to focus on areas where maybe we have less demand than we have supply or in specific countries where we want to focus and kind of grow the overall kind of pie for us. So it is not the primary driver of it but this overall strategy of leading with brands and then following with surgical on our search engine marketing continues to work really well for us. And then in terms of the ADR, I think that the unlock of the variable expense improvements we've been making has just continued to enable us to drive profitable growth, right? We have -- our fixed cost growth discipline has been excellent, probably grow our fixed -- headcount this year, approximately 4%. So we're growing our head count and fixed expenses less than revenue. We continue to make great strides of improvement in our operations and support and Brian talked about a lot of the opportunities we have going forward in customer service. And then we're continuing to make good strides in cost of payments, our infrastructure costs, etcetera. That's not our primary driver. Like our primary focus is still on growth. Growth of the business, making hosting mainstream, perfecting the core service and expanding down the core and the fact that I can do all those things and do it while still doing it profitably and actually expanding our overall margins this year, it is something that I'm just very proud of.\nOperator: And we'll move to our next question from Lloyd Walmsley at UBS.\nLloyd Walmsley: My question, you guys have been talking a lot about innovating on the search experience, like working on GenAI, the community side, things like co-hosting. Do you see a path where some of these features over the longer term like community in search drive enough differentiation that you could bring on more traditional supply, things like boutique hotels in such a way that you kind of expand your addressable market and revenue per user while still sort of preserving enough that's unique about Airbnb? Is that sort of makes sense? Or is that just too far out there?\nBrian Chesky: No, Lloyd, that absolutely makes sense. And I think that's inevitability. Just to back up for a second, we are very much supportive having hotel inventory on Airbnb. And we acquired HotelTonight before the pandemic because we believe so much in it. Over the last few years, we had to make some decisions, especially when our business initially contracted and we made some decisions. We said, well, we have to really just get focused on our core. And our core were individual people renting homes, sharing homes. That is the most differentiated thing. It's inventory you can't find anywhere else. It's a thing that is most defensible, is the thing that attracts all the direct traffic. That being said, I mean, let's just take New York, for example. We still have a lot of traffic of people searching for New York and we now have a lot less inventory we used to have so there's a real opportunity for us to supplement what used to be homes with boutique hotels. They're already on hotel tonight and others and we can certainly put those in New York. And I generally think for sure, as Airbnb becomes a little more of a so-called like AI travel agent which is what I think all travel apps will trend towards to some extent. I think there's opportunity for us to do things in a differentiated way even with slightly less differentiated inventory. I think our bread and butter for combinations are always going to be home. I think that's where our heart and soul is. I also think that's where the biggest growth opportunity is but you should not think of our total supply -- addressable market of supply as only homes. We've had hotels. We've just been prioritizing homes because we wanted to be really focused.\nOperator: Next, we'll move to Kenneth Gawrelski at Wells Fargo.\nKenneth Gawrelski: Appreciate it. Two questions, if I may. First, I want to go back to supply. I know you've talked a lot about it. The room nights up 19% with double-digit growth in all territories. Yet every week, we read about new STR regulations. At least in North America, could you help us reconcile this kind of this contrast for the financial market? Like what are we missing as investors here -- where is that supply growth really happening, especially in the kind of Western markets? And then my second question to be a bit more specific, I know you called out the volatility in room nights and on the demand side in 4Q. Are there any specific regions that you would call out? Or is it more broad-based? And just on the timing standpoint, did this start in October? Or did you see some of the volatility start in 3Q?\nBrian Chesky: Maybe I'll -- go for it, Dave.\nDavid Stephenson: Well, I'll just start with the volatility in room nights. There's not a specific region where we're seeing it. I think maybe the biggest thing we've seen is that it's more broad-based on a global basis right now which is why we've kind of called out the macroeconomic and potential geopolitical issues as a potential driver to it. We saw maybe some of it just late September and it's kind of been early October. And again, it's just a little too early to tell how much volatility we see going into the rest of the quarter. That's why we continue to highlight the revenue growth that we're still expecting this year between 12% and 14% and our growth overall. And then on the regulation side, I mean, I think it's a lot of what Brian said earlier that 80% of our top 200 markets already have regulation. I think the headlines, they tend to make good headlines when people are highlighting kind of issues with short-term regulation. But in many ways, outside of New York City, I've never been -- felt better about our overall regulatory landscape on a global basis. We have really good partnerships with many cities around the world and things like our City Portal and other things has made us continue to collaborate extremely well with the vast majority of cities. So, I think those are outliers. But Brian?\nBrian Chesky: Yes. Yes. And I'd just say, like, again, we're in like 100,000 cities around the world and for every headline you read, there's cities that actually have very workable solutions. There's not a lot of activity. We're actually seeing growth in supply across all types of markets, not just big cities where you see in headlines. And I think vacation rental destinations -- in fact, there's a U.S. Census report that we looked at. I think said that 2/3 of markets where Airbnb exist, there aren't even hotel. So if you just think about that way, there's a lot of markets where there aren't even hotels, especially in the vacation rental in the nonurban areas. So the way I'd reconcile it is just to say that like while you read headlines about a few cities, they actually represent a very small percentage of the overall market concentration that we have.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Conor Cunningham at Melius Research.\nConor Cunningham: Just on the 2/3 of the hosts that are using the pricing tool today, as you add new supply, you mentioned that ADRs of new supply is at a higher rate but are those people more likely to use the discounting tools that you've kind of mentioned after they've listed before? And then maybe on the implications for take rate when you move into international markets, you're tracking towards -- over 50% of your rooms are going to be there. Is take rate can eventually just kind of bleed lower as that expands? Just curious on your thinking about that overall.\nBrian Chesky: Yes, I can take the first one, Conor. On tools, generally, new host adopt new tools at a higher rate than existing host. And the reason why is like when you sign up, like we have this really great onboarding and you're immediately presented with all the tools. Now we do have a percentage of our host, maybe like, call it, 1 million hosts that are highly, highly engaged and they're going to be really engaged on a lot of these tools. But every new host, as far as they're concerned, every tool is like -- is exactly how you're supposed to use Airbnb, whereas an older host, there's an adoption where you have to get them on to the new tools and they're used to hosting a certain way. So we're generally seeing that new host would probably adopt new tools at a faster rate than existing host. That being said, the ADR-related new host might also be related to the mix shift. We're getting a lot of inventory in nonurban areas. They're larger homes. So there's a lot of different reasons I can explain that. Dave, I can hand over to you.\nDavid Stephenson: Yes. And can you read the second question again, it was take-rate on international host?\nConor Cunningham: Yes. Just as you expand internationally, is there going to be a natural reduction in take rate overall as that kind of tracks over 50% of your overall rooms at some point?\nDavid Stephenson: No. I mean, actually, I think over time, the way we think about our take rate is that it's been very stable. We've actually made no underlying kind of recent changes to our absolute take rate. And what we want to be able to do is as we add more services and capabilities, that would be the way to further kind of monetize Airbnb. So what have we done things like adding guest travel insurance has been a nice add for kind of incremental monetization. It's small but it's growing nicely. And then as Brian said, there as we kind of expand beyond core and add more services for host and guests, that will be the way to kind of increase it.\nBrian Chesky: And you could -- theoretically, you could argue the inverse which is to say that as the expanded new markets, they might be more interested in new services that we can offer because hosting is newer to them. So as we expand in new markets and as we expand to new host services, we want to make sure that new host and new markets are percent of those opportunities.\nOperator: And there are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the conference back to Brian Chesky for closing remarks.\nBrian Chesky: All right. Well, thanks, everyone, for joining today. Just to recap, revenue was $3.4 billion, 18% higher than a year ago. Net income and adjusted EBITDA were both Q3 records. And as well -- I just want to -- the last thing I want to highlight is our trailing 12-month free cash flow was $4.2 billion. And this represents a free cash flow margin of 44%. And so I just want to call out the real incredible hard work that the team has done over the last 3 years. We've been really, really disciplined to try to make this business a cash-generating machine and to be really focused. And I think the team has made some great progress. Next week, we're going to take a leap forward in making Airbnb more reliable with some big updates as part of our 2023 winter release. So I hope you can tune in. It's next Wednesday, November 8, to learn more and I'll see you there.\nOperator: And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "ABNB", "quarter": 2, "year": 2023, "date": "2023-08-03 20:33:15", "content": "Operator: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining Airbnb's earnings conference call for the Second Quarter of 2023. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations section of Airbnb's website following this call. I will now hand the call over to Ellie Mertz, VP of Finance. Please go ahead.\nEllie Mertz: Good afternoon, and welcome to Airbnb's Second Quarter of 2023 Earnings Call. Thank you for joining us today. On the call today, we have Airbnb's Co-Founder and CEO, Brian Chesky; and our Chief Financial Officer, Dave Stephenson.  Earlier today, we issued a Shareholder Letter with our financial results and commentary for our second quarter of 2023. These items were also posted on the Investor Relations section of Airbnb's website. During the call, we'll make brief opening remarks, and then spend the remainder of time on Q&A. Before I turn it over to Brian, I would like to remind everyone that we'll be making forward-looking statements on this call that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described under Forward-looking Statements in our Shareholder Letter and in our most recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained on this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. You should be aware that these statements should be considered estimates only and are not a guarantee of future performance. Also during this call, we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures. We provided reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in the Shareholder Letter posted to our IR website. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP results. With that, I will pass the call to Brian.\nBrian Chesky: All right. Thank you Ellie. And Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining today. I'm excited to share our results with you. Q2 was another strong quarter for Airbnb. We had over 115 million nights and experiences booked. Revenue of $2.5 billion grew 18% year-over-year. And when you exclude foreign exchange, our revenue increased 19% year-over-year. Net income was $650 million, representing a net income margin of 26%, our highest second quarter ever. And free cash flow for the quarter was $900 million, up 13% year-over-year. In fact, on a trailing 12-month basis, our free cash flow was $3.9 billion. And this represented a trailing 12-month free cash flow margin of 43%. And because of our strong cash flow and balance sheet, we were able to repurchase $2.5 billion of our stock in the last 12 months, which is more than offset the impact of shared dilution. Now, during the quarter, we saw a number of positive business trends. First, guest demand in Airbnb remained strong. Nights and experiences booked increased 11% in Q2 compared to a year ago. Active bookers grew in every region, and we had more first-time bookers compared to a year ago. In fact, we've now had more than 1.5 billion guest arrivals since starting Airbnb. Second, guests are traveling farther. Cross-border nights booked increased 16% in Q2 compared to a year ago. And we are especially encouraged by the continued recovery of Asia Pacific, where inbound international travel increased 80% compared to this time last year. And we also saw cross-border nights booked to North America increase 20% year-over-year. And finally, the third trend we're seeing is that guests are staying longer on Airbnb. Millions of people remain flexible about where they live and work, and we see this reflected in our bookings. In Q2, long-term stays remain 18% of total nights booked. And throughout the quarter, we saw an acceleration in year-over-year growth in bookings for month these days. Now, while the ability to travel and work remotely has been an important part of long-term stay growth, people are also extending their typical weekend stays by an extra night or two. In fact, in the past six quarters, long stays, long weekend stays have been the fastest growing trip type on Airbnb. I think this is just evidence of the incremental flexibility people have post-pandemic. Now, given that we're halfway through 2023, I just want to provide a very quick update on the progress we made across our three strategic priorities. First, we are focused on making hosting mainstream. With supply growth stagnated at the beginning of COVID, we developed a new strategy to recruit more hosts. Since then, we've been focused on raising awareness around hosting, making it easier to get started, and improving our tools for hosts. And our strategy is working.  In Q2, supply growth is 19% year-over-year, and this is actually up from 18% in Q1. In fact, in every quarter since we've gone public, we've seen an acceleration in total active listings growth. And we're continuing to see strong supply growth across all regions, all market types, and all price points. In fact, we added a record number of new listings in Q2, and we ended the quarter with more than 7 million total active listings. Second, we're perfecting our core service. We want people to love our service, and that means obsessing over every detail. Millions of people have given us feedback on how to improve Airbnb. We've listened. On May 3rd, we introduced over 50 new features and upgrades as part of our 2023 summer release. Now many of these new features and upgrades were aimed at addressing affordability, starting with new pricing tools for hosts. Hosts told us that our pricing tools are difficult to use. So we redesigned our tools, and we made it easier for hosts to add discounts and promotions. They also told us that they had trouble setting competitive prices. So we added a new feature called similar listings to help them see listings in their area so they know what to charge. Now we received very positive feedback from our hosts, and the changes are already having an impact. Hosts have started lowering their prices, and and with more of them offering weekly and monthly discounts. And as more hosts adopt these tools, we believe we'll be able to drive greater affordability and value for guests. We also rolled out more affordable monthly stays. Guests are staying longer in Airbnb. So we took steps to make longer stays more affordable. We significantly reduced fees for stays longer than three months. We started offering U.S. guests the option to save money by paying with their bank account, and we made it easier for hosts to offer monthly discounts. And as a result, the percentage of our new active listings to offer monthly discount jumped from 22% to 50%. Now we took another step to address affordability with the launch of Airbnb rooms. Airbnb rooms takes us back to our founding ethos of sharing, and it's one of the most affordable ways to travel. Airbnb rooms have an average price of only $67 per night, significantly lower than the average hotel room. Given the increased price sensitivity for many guests, especially the next generation of travelers, this is going to remain an important category for Airbnb. And finally, our third strategic priority is to expand beyond the core. We spent the past few years perfecting our core service. We've rolled out hundreds of new features and upgrades. And today, our core is stronger and more profitable than ever, but we're not stopping there because we have some big ideas for where to take Airbnb next. And we're building the foundational capability for these new product and services that we plan to launch in the years to come. Now, before I turn to Q&A, I want to tell you about a recent campaign that highlights what makes Airbnb unique. Airbnb is known for one of a kind listings. As I'm sure you know, the Barbie movie just came out in theaters. And in celebration of the premiere, we partnered with Warner Brothers and Mattel to transform a home into the Barbie Malibu Dreamhouse. And we launched it as part of our Only on Airbnb campaign. Only on Airbnb caps in the global pop culture moments, inspiring guests with some of the most iconic homes in the world. The Barbie Malibu Dreamhouse has been a sensation, and it is now Airbnb's most popular listing ever. We saw 13,000 press hits and more than 250 million social media impressions since it was announced. And to give you a sense of how much that is, that is twice, more than twice as many press hits as were generated from our IPO. Only on Airbnb campaigns are an effective way to introduce Airbnb and our unique inventory to new guests, and they'll be an important part of our playbook going forward. So those are the results that we have to share for Q2. And with that, Dave and I look forward to answering your question. \nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll go to our first question from Mario Lu at Barclays.\nMario Lu: Great. Thanks for taking question. So the first one is on the third quarter ADR guide. You said it's upward pressure in the quarter. Can you help explain what you mean by the listing type mix shift that's kind of listing up ADRs?\nBrian Chesky: Yes, the listing type mix shift is just simply the mix of types of listings, either geographic type of size of home location, that's right in the mix. And so ADRs coming up due to that. And it's also being coming up in the third quarter driven by foreign exchange.\nMario Lu: Okay, got it. And then in terms of your section on the operational take rate, you guys mentioned that you're offering a lower take rate, especially for stays after the third month. Does that mean, over time, should we expect this number to come down? Or are there kind of offsets that you're going to provide to keep the operational take rate flat? Thanks.\nBrian Chesky: Yes, that's Mario. I can answer that. We always want to make sure that we're providing the very best value for our guests. We identified this is a huge opportunity where we could drive incremental conversion by taking take rates down after the third month. And we saw some really great results. That being said, I do not expect our take rates to change materially. There may be some segments or trip types or geographies where we would want to take it down, but that could be offset by other areas that could come up. And so generally, I would expect it to be pretty stable. And the way that we're going to see margin expansion is by launching incremental services for guests and hosts over the coming years.\nMario Lu: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll move next to Jed Kelly at Oppenheimer.\nJed Kelly: Hey, great, great. Thanks for taking my question. Just following up on the listing pipe, are you still adding more of that like vacation rental single unit inventory versus some of like call it the smaller units and urban vacation and urban areas? And then can you just give us an update on how we should think about your marketing into the back half? Thank you. \nBrian Chesky: Yes. Hey, Jed, I can start and I'll hand over to Dave. So our supply, I mean, let me just back up, our supply has actually been really, really strong. You might remember that being a COVID, we were, we flagged this as something we need to work on. That's why we created an initiative called mainstreaming hosting. And the results have been very successful. In fact, supply growth is growing 19% year-over-year. And in fact, urban is actually growing faster in vacation. Urban is growing 20% whereas vacation is growing 19%. So that is pretty stable. And as far as the number of individual hosts versus what we describe as professional hosts, around 90% of our hosts remain individuals. I'll hand over to Dave.\nDavid Stephenson: Yes, on the marketing back half, I mean, our marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue we expect to remain relatively flat year-over-year on a total year basis from 2023 over 2022. We did pull forward more marketing to the first half of the year relative to the second half this year. We've been really pleased with the results. So I mean, remember that 90% of our traffic remains direct or unpaid. I think that's an important differentiator versus others. And then when we do things like the Barbie dream house and other big, events like that, we're able to kind of drive more awareness about Airbnb about the uniqueness of our offerings. And this is a powerful strategy for our marketing.\nBrian Chesky: Yes, maybe I'll just add one thing about marketing is just, it's a full funnel approach. And last year we got 600,000 articles written about us. So people talk a lot about Airbnb. And now I think what you're also seeing is social media, whether it's the only on program Barbie or just generally every means social media is just a topic of conversation. I think that is just a testament to when you invest in a brand, when your brand's a noun and a verb, and you have something unique, you get a lot of those benefits. And I think it's going to be consistent and we'll have pretty consistent marketing expenses to send a revenue over time because of the strength of the brand.\nJed Kelly: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll go next to Douglas Anmuth at JP Morgan. \nDouglas Anmuth: Hey, this is [indiscernible].. Thanks for taking the question, but I have two. So first one through this affordability. Are you actually seeing that consumers are coming to your platform seeing that the prices are high and walking away and do you feel like that's an opportunity that you guys aren't capturing? Or is it just the case that people are okay with higher prices on the platform right now? And the second thing on the other side for the full year, where does it see the outside to raise your point?\nBrian Chesky: I don't, we're not able to hear the second question. I don't think. Can you say one more time? \nDouglas Anmuth: Yes, sorry, on your full year guidance for adjusted EBITDA where did you see upside to give you the confidence to raise it?\nBrian Chesky: Yes, so I'll take the first question and I'll hand over to Dave. On affordability, our prices have, have obviously risen since pre-pandemic and the growth has been incredible in the business is nearly about twice the size that was pre-pandemic. That being said, in the long run, Airbnb started as an affordable alternative to hotels. And I think that we always have to remember that for every dollar people spend on Airbnb, they spend as much as many as $10 in the world on hotels. So we're still a very small player in a very large market. And I think that one of our big opportunities is to make sure we continue to be affordable. Last year, we got a lot of feedback from the community that Airbnb wasn't as affordable as it used to be. So we made a bunch of changes. We highlighted some of these in my opening remarks. What we've seen though, since then, I'll answer your question. People, the book prices on Airbnb, on average, are lower than the listed prices. So we do see people gravitating towards more affordable stays listed in Airbnb. It's partly why we launched a feature called similar listings, which help us see the listings that we're getting booked. And what hosts I think discovered was the most popular listings that made the most money offered many times the very best value. And so this was, in a sense, a win-win for guests in the house by really trying to build better tools. I also just want to point out one thing, which is our prices are essentially flat year by year. I think they're about 1% up year-over-year, but in North America, our prices are now down 1%. Now, when you take out mixed shifts, because people are booking larger homes, our prices in North America are actually down 4%. And if you compare it to hotels, depending upon which data you take, hotels are up some between 4% or as much as 10%. And it seems like hotels are suggesting, based on some of the public remarks, that they aren't going to come down. In fact, those prices might come up. So to answer your question, I think people come to Airbnb for one of the kindspaces at great value. And if we can keep prices very affordable, and then also focus on reliability, I think there's going to be a lot of demand to come.\nDavid Stephenson: And then in terms of profitability, I'm just really proud of our continued progress of increasing our overall margins over time. We made some hard choices in the midst of COVID to reduce our fixed costs, get back to the core, and focus on our overall profitability. The major shifts of things like our marketing expenses that we just talked about, where 90% of our traffic remains direct or unpaid, it gives us a lot of leverage for improving our overall profitability. And we're going to continue to do that this year. We continue to make great improvements in our overall variable costs, things like operations and support costs, or community support, infrastructure costs, etc. And then we've just been doing an excellent job of being very judicious with our fixed cost growth. So we've moderated our headcount growth overall. We're growing modestly, and we're investing behind the things that matter most for our guest center hosts. And I think that focus is actually enabling us to deliver even more innovations, as Brian talked about on the call, like, and we've had over 500 improvements to Airbnb in the last several years. And so we're going to continue to manage our fixed costs closely, focusing on the things that matter. So for the back half of the year, we feel confident we're going to be able to exceed our EBITDA margins over the prior year.\nBrian Chesky: And I think I'll just add that, I think that we found that as we get more efficient, we actually grow faster. So I think being incredibly disciplined, incredibly focused, incredibly lean has actually been great for growth.\nDouglas Anmuth: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Stephen Ju at Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nStephen Ju: Okay, thank you. So Brian, the shareholder letter is teasing us a little bit with the commentary about Expand Beyond the Core, but there really isn't much there beyond the statement itself. So in addition to experiences, and please share any updates in terms of what you may be doing there, but what could be some of these new directions you might be thinking about that might be products and services for either the host or the consumer. Thanks.\nBrian Chesky: Hey, Steven, thanks for the question. It's one of my favorite questions. What are we going to do next? Let me just start and back up. I just want to recap today how I think about this whole space. Before we talk about Expand Beyond the Core, I just want to say one thing about the Core, which is that the hotel industry is more than about 10 times the size of Airbnb. And I think that almost anyone that stays in a hotel could consider staying in an Airbnb. I mean, the spaces are one of a kind. They're often better value, but we need to make sure that we continue to drive value. And I think the next big focus for Airbnb is reliability. We can make Airbnb even nearly as reliable in many markets and hotels. I think you're going to open up a whole new generation of travelers to Airbnb. So I think there's a lot more runway just in the core business. I think we're only scratching the surface, and that's partly why we are so focused on perfecting our core. Now, beyond that, let's talk about what's next, starting from the most nearest adjacencies out international. One of the things we've seen is that Airbnb has a lot of, we've got a lot of scale in the United States, and we've got a lot of scale in top markets in Europe, but actually, Airbnb is under-penetrated in most countries around the world. Just to give you an example, a couple years ago, a few years ago, we were concerned about the lack of penetration we had in Germany. We were also pretty nascent in Brazil. Since the beginning of the pandemic, Brazil is more than double the size, and Germany is more than 60% larger. And Germany is on track now to be one of the largest countries in the world on Airbnb. So we're going to take that playbook, and we're going to bring it to Asia, and we're starting with Japan and Korea. But Asia Pacific is a frontier. It's a huge opportunity for growth. I think that is just one of many markets, including Latin America. And the other thing I should point out within Europe is, beyond UK, beyond France, beyond some of the really top markets, there's a lot of countries in Europe where we're not actually that penetrated. So there's a lot of international expansion. Next would be longer stays. Before the pandemic, only 13% of our business was for monthly stays. Now it's 18%, and it's stable, and we don't think it's going down. In fact, I think this is a huge opportunity. I think all you have to believe is Zoom is here to stay to believe flexibility is here to stay. If you believe that, you're going to see a lot more people either living nominally or some people traveling for the summer, going away for the winter, or extend to weekends, which is a whole new category between travel and housing. So I think that is probably one of the most underrated markets in Airbnb. You have experiences. I thought experiences were going to have a breakout before the pandemic, and instead we had to put them on hold. But the thing we've learned is that people love experiences. 95% of reviews that are left for experiences end in a five-star review. And for our core business homes, it's 84%. So that means that people on a statistical basis like experience even more than homes. And so we think that product is being \u2013 is ready to scale. And so I've been spending a lot of time. I think you're going to see some growth in the years to come. And I'll just add a couple more things. And let me preface this by saying I don't usually like to foreshadow new things before we launch them. I got to get you to tune into our releases, which we do every May and November. But there's a lot of service opportunities on guests and hosts. I think that, whether it's Eats, Amazon, or Etsy, or Alibaba, they've shown there's an entire suite of services that you can offer for hosts. I know I get a lot of questions about paid placement, which is absolutely on the table. But there's many other services as well for hosts. And then in guest services, think about all the services you could get in a hotel or at a resort. And then think of all the services that a hotel couldn't maybe afford to offer because they're at sub-scale. But Airbnb, in many markets, we've got a lot of critical scale. So these are just some of the \u2013 I would just even call it near-term opportunities. But we do have some pretty big ideas. I think AI is basically like a once-in-a-generation platform shift, probably bigger than the shift to mobile, probably more akin to something like the Internet as far as what it can do for new businesses and new business opportunities. And I think that it is a huge opportunity for us to really be in the leading edge of innovation. So that's what we're doing. I'm very, very excited about it. And I will just say that we made a lot of progress the last three years, building a strong business, being profitable. But my strength as CEO is really about expanding beyond the core. So this is where I think we're going to be entering our sweet spot in the coming years to come.\nStephen Ju: Thank you. \nOperator: We'll move next to Bernard McTernan at Needham & Company.\nBernard McTernan: Great. Thank you for taking questions. Maybe just start just \u2013 if you could just discuss the booking trends throughout the quarter where April is up 10%, going to June plus 15%, anything that you saw that was driving that better performance throughout the quarter. And then on pricing, you mentioned the new pricing tools focused on affordability. Are we seeing the full impact of that in 3Q, or how should we expect that to trend throughout the coming quarters?\nBrian Chesky: Let me start with the booking trends. What we saw was \u2013 what we shared in the letter, which is that the global booking trends increased from 10% growth year-over-year in April to 15% in June. And if you remember what we saw on Q2 was a hard comparison year-over-year, specifically driven by Europe, where there were delayed bookings in 2022 that compressed more bookings into Q2. That pressure moderated through the quarter, which is the primary reason why we're seeing that acceleration. And interestingly, we actually saw acceleration in total [growth on both book] from Q1 to Q2 in North America. And so I think that was telling about just the strength and resiliency of the North American consumer. And we're continuing to see that strength lead into Q3, which is why we're forecasting further acceleration of Knight's growth from Q2 into Q3. We're seeing great growth in Asia Pacific, as we called out in the letter, over 80 percent growth in APAC. And I'm really pleased with our growth in Latin America. It's twice the size that it was pre-COVID, and it's growing really nicely. And then in terms of the pricing tools, I think that we have seen a number of positive impacts from our pricing tools. As we talked about earlier, in North America, ADR actually being down 1 percent year-over-year when excluding the impact of mixed, it's actually down 4%. I don't think we've seen the full impact of all of those. I think we're going to continue to improve and make the pricing tools better for our hosts. And then to make it more transparent for what the prices are that they should charge so that they know what a competitive rate is. And I think we'll continue to make sure that we're providing great value, because while our prices are either moderating or even coming down, that's in the face of other competing platforms actually increasing rates. And so I think the value gap continues to grow, which just shows the benefit of booking on Airbnb expanding.\nBernard McTernan: Great. Thanks, Dave.\nOperator: We'll go next to Jacob [indiscernible] at TD Cowen. \nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, this is Jacob in for Kevin. Thanks for taking my question. We've been getting a lot of questions from investors on potential initiatives that Airbnb could do moving forward to increase take grade, which could maybe include letting advertisers bid on a platform. I was wondering if you could write any details there. Also, you discussed a bit in this call that you had already rolled out expansion tools in Germany and Brazil. I was wondering if you could comment on any of the results that you're seeing so far. Thanks.\nDavid Stephenson: Yes, I'll start. So with regards to increasing take rate, one of the things I've learned, actually Dave was somebody who told me this, it's something from Jeff Bezos at Amazon. He said that one of the things you have to do as a business leader is you have to be focused, and you have to focus on the most perishable opportunities first. And so I think that the most perishable initial opportunity Airbnb was to get focused and disciplined and really rationalize our cost base. And then when we saw a travel recovery, it was about getting market share. And I think that's still where we're focused on. So, advertising on the platform is a common request. Certainly, it's a common thing I get asked on earnings calls. It is absolutely on the table. I think we could do a very good job at it. It is not one of the most perishable opportunities. It's just why we haven't prioritized it. We're really prioritizing getting Airbnb to as much scale as possible and continue to grow. So, but it is absolutely on the table. And just to dive in this a little bit deeper, there is such an opportunity for us to build differentiated tools, services, and offerings for hosts. You think about it, over the last few years, we made, as Dave referenced, almost over 500 upgrades in innovation. Probably around half of those happened for hosts, literally hundreds of improvements. And most of these we don't charge for. They have nothing to do with our take rate. Our take rate was what it was even before all these, like air cover, which is top to bottom protection with $3 million of damage protection. That is free to our hosts and our competitors don't offer it. I do think though, while we always want to make sure we're providing more value for hosts for whatever we're charging, there's a lot of opportunities. Obviously an advertising platform is one, matching people with homes that need, that don't have time to host with hosts who can host but don't have a home, really matching that marketplace. But I think a lot more, a lot more business that we call them co-hosts, so creating a co-host marketplace is really interesting. And there's a plethora of other services on the host side. And again, there's also a plethora of services on the guest side as well. So those, for things that make the experience better, I would say would be more perishable. With regards to Germany and Brazil, I can have Dave just talk about it in a second. But before I do, I'll just say that, we are, I think the most international travel company in the world, we are not concentrating Europe. We're not concentrating North America. We're truly everywhere. We're in almost every country and region in the world. It's truly a global travel network. And I think we have a really good playbook for how to expand into these markets. And I think Germany and Brazil was a really interesting playbook where we didn't just focus on brand, but we also focus on PR, social media. We leverage like local celebrities that often will do promotions with Airbnb.  And so there's a, and this is, in addition to localizing our product and really making sure we have a key product and we have good supply in the corridors that these people will travel to. I think Germany and Brazil are good stories. Germany is more than 60% larger than it was before the pandemic. I believe Brazil is like 110% larger. I don't know if Dave, you want to go into anything else?\nBrian Chesky: I think you hit it. Well, I'll just reinforce a couple of things. I mean, step one in 80s markets is make sure that we well localized the product. Usually the product can be very consistent globally, but often payment methods are areas where we need to make sure that we're being very localized. And then this full funnel approach is key. Making sure that we have all of the elements, social, NPR, celebrity and brand and search engine marketing. We often start in some of these markets with just the search engine marketing, but that's too narrow and we need the full funnel to see the effect. And I think when we have that full funnel approach, you get the results that we're seeing in Brazil and Germany. That's why we're expanding that on to Asia for both like Japan and South Korea. And then I'll even go back to the potential initiatives for loan because I think it's important to double click on the fact that you have to remember that the majority of our hosts are individual hosts and the things that we need to build are for those individuals So for example, adding advertising, we have to be mindful that we don't just add something like that that can disproportionately benefit professional hosts over individuals and take the balance of the marketplace out of balance. And I think it's really important to do that because that's what's unique and different about Airbnb. We're not built on the backs of professional hosts. We're glad they're there. We're glad they're part of the ecosystem, but it's even more important that we support our individual host community.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great, thank you.\nOperator: We'll go next to Brian Nowak at Morgan Stanley.\nBrian Nowak: Thanks for taking my question out. Dave, just to go back to earlier question on ADRs being up in 3Q, I get geographic size location, it's better, but could you just give us a little more detail about that so we can understand sort of is that geographic comp structure? What are the sizes you're talking about? We're just trying to understand how to think about the drivers of the ADR growth in the third quarter and the durability of that growth into next year. \nDavid Stephenson: Yes, I think what we're seeing in the near term for Q3 is what we've included here. We're anticipating it to be up year-over-year driven by foreign exchange and the mix shift of larger homes and geographic mix. I think over time, because we're seeing things like Latin America growing nicely, Asia growing nicely and more of cross-border travel, you could see some moderation of our ADRs over time, but again, we're talking moderation, we're talking a percentage point in our here or there. We have better visibility into Q3 right now, which thinks it's going to be up year over year, longer term, it could be flat-ish to maybe moderately down over time, but at the same time, we keep predicting that ADRs are going to decrease and each quarter, it's been amazingly resilient throughout the last few number of quarters, so I don't have much more to say beyond that.\nOperator: We'll go to our next question from James Lee at Mizuho.\nJames Lee: Great, thanks for taking my questions. Two here, one on ADR, you guys talk about, obviously, North America decreased by one percent. I was wondering if you can maybe unpack between life alike and maybe next shift, so we can better understand the dynamic. And also secondly, maybe can you talk about the price elasticity as you're allowing hosts to use the tools to adjust the pricing? What do you see from consumer out there, travelers out there, in terms of reacting to those price changes? Thanks.\nBrian Chesky: Sure, we absolutely measure the price elasticity of our pricing and we see a good benefit from lower pricing driving increased nights overall. I think, obviously, affordability is super important in people's minds all around the world. We definitely see it specifically in North America where while calendar prices have increased, that is the average price available on Airbnb have gone up, the booking prices of what people are actually booking are declining. So that just shows you the desire for people to have great value. In North America specifically, what we saw was it was down 1% year-of-year, but like for like, so that means the same property on average, excluding mix of size, location, and type was actually down 4%. So on a like for like basis our ADRs in North America is actually down 4%. And that's very different than what we're seeing the hotel industry kind of touting increases of six to 10% or more. So that's where the gap in value continues to widen. \nJames Lee: Okay, I have one more question here, Dave. A lot of investors are asking about maybe student loan forgiveness, expiration. I was wondering how you think about this issue, anything that's contemplating into your guidance for FY23. Thanks.\nDavid Stephenson: Yes. I don't have a specific point of view on the student loan forgiveness and impact on guidance. I think what we're seeing is that in the face -- people keep waiting for the economic shoe to drop and get concerned about whether or not people are willing to travel and whether the economy is going to have a drag on our overall results. And it's just not what we're seeing. We're seeing a strong resilience in travel that people are prioritizing, travel over other things. And all the work that we're doing to make sure that we're providing great value and even either moderating or having prices come down just gives us greater value relative to alternatives, which I think is the tailwind on why we're continuing to, by all of our estimates, gain share of total accommodation nights, both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. \nJames Lee: Okay, great, thank you. \nOperator: We'll go next to Ken Gawrelski at Wells Fargo Securities. \nKen Gawrelski: Hi, thank you. I want to come back to the ADR issue. And Brian, if you could talk about-it was very helpful detail on the 4% kind of like for like in North America, but how do I square Dave's comments that you see overall ADRs kind of flattish over the medium term with your comments that you want to continue to drive affordability? I know you've introduced some tools and you're seeing some impact there. And maybe the follow-up to that is, how will you know when the marketplace is in balance and where you've kind of reached equilibrium and the ADRs in the right place? Thank you. \nBrian Chesky: Again, yes, I'll start. So I think affordability and our prices have to be taken into account relative to the rest of the market. Obviously inflation is up, most everything in the world is more expensive today than it was a year ago. And I presume that will be the case next year this time. We know, for example, that while our price in North America like for like or down 4% hotels are at least 4% higher in some estimates are they might even be approaching double digits higher. And based on recent comments I've been hearing, I think they expect for prices to continue to go up. So if we live in a world where Airbnb prices do not go up and the even remain flat or stable and hotels continue to rise, then Airbnb continues to become more affordable relative to hotels, which are still much larger audience than Airbnb. But that brings up a different question, which is, how do you balance the right prices for guest and host? It's good to the marketplace. And so we have hosts, these aren't just suppliers we have no relationship with. So our goal is not to drive down prices as low as possible. The prices have to find a balance between the very best affordability for guests while still making sure a host can make any meaningful income and it's still really valuable income for them to earn. Now, one of the things we've seen is there's a lot of sensitivities you can look at that we can show hosts that when you lower your prices to a point, you actually will get more business because most hosts have very low occupancy. They're not like hotels. A hotel is usually booked like 20, 25 nights a month. Maybe some hotels are booked 30 days a month. Most hosts are not booked most nights. And so the big deal is that they lower the price just a little bit. They will add more bookings, more nights and they'll end up making more money. There's a point where they lower it so much though that it's no longer worth their while. And that is the secret sauce for us to be able to perfectly balance supply and demand to make sure that both sides it's working for them. And I think that equilibrium, that balance between guests and hosts, that kind of is one of our secret sauces. \nJames Lee: Thank you. \nOperator: And next we'll move to Tom Champion at Piper Sandler. \nTom Champion: Hi, good afternoon. Looks like you've built some tools to stimulate or offer long-term stays. And I'm just curious what you think that will ultimately do to the rate, which is kind of hovered around the 18% rate for room nights to the last couple quarters now. Where do you see that going over time? And then Dave, I guess a question for you. Another very strong quarter for EBITDA margins. What do you see the long-term margin potential of the business over time? Just curious if you've updated that. Thank you. \nBrian Chesky: Hey Tom, I'll take the first one. So long-term stays are 18% of our nights book. Long-term stays obviously defined by a month or longer. And as I mentioned before, they were around 13% before the pandemic. Now, it's very hard to predict exactly how it will change in the next one, two, three, four quarters from now. So I'm not going to make a prediction about where 18% might be in Q4 or next Q1. But what I can say with a fair amount of confidence is I think in the next decade, it's going to be a lot higher than 18%. I think the overall wins are towards longer and longer stays. And the reason why is because more than ever in any time in human history, you've got hundreds of millions of people and one day, perhaps more than a billion people that have a job via laptop that has some incremental flexibility that did not exist 10 or 20 years ago. Think about the number of people that are young that don't have a family and can actually work from a laptop and move around. Then you have people of families that have kids in school that can't do that, but their kids aren't in school in the summer. So you're going to see more and more people still go away from the summer. Many people are thinking about going away for the winter. People are moving away from headquarters, but they might come back, give a work for extended periods. So I think this basic thing we think is going to happen is there's going to be a lot more flexibility in the future. And I think there's going to be a category that is not travel and it's not classic housing, housing as in one year leases or real estate. There's going to be a category in between. And it doesn't even really have a name, but our stays of 30 days are longer. I mean, that is around 100 million nights booked a year. So that is actually a major new category of business that didn't really exist in a meaningful way when we started Airbnb. And if anyone in the world wants to book a stay of a month or longer, and they're going to book site on scene, so they're going to book a place they can't visit and do a tour ahead of time, I think Airbnb is going to be the leading place to do. And there really isn't another global player that you can do with this. So ultimately, I can't predict the short term, but the long term, we're very bullish. And we actually have a lot more features and upgrades in this area of monthly stays that I think will increase adoption. And also to be able to get people that only want to host on a monthly basis to come on Airbnb, that would actually unlock lots of new listings. Dave, I'll hand over to you. \nDavid Stephenson: Yes, thanks for the question, EBITDA margins I am really proud of our progress towards it. We've made some substantial progress based on things like the change in our marketing approach, improvements in variable costs or fixed cost leverage. Also remember that the higher average daily rates have helped our overall margins and kind of accelerated overall profitability. That said, we are in growth mode. I'm really not focused on optimizing margins. I'm proud of the fact that we can grow well and drive great profitable growth, but we are focused on growth. I think the extent that we'll expand our margins over time, I think the biggest opportunity to be with some of the services that Brian mentioned earlier in the call, as we add guests to our host services, I think that will increase the lovers of revenue that we can gain and much of that revenue will flow through to kind of higher overall profitability. But all that said, I don't have a new long-term target. I'm just proud of the fact that we've been able to deliver the profitability we have as quickly as we have.\nTom Champion : Thank you both. \nBrian Chesky: Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we'll move to Mark Mahaney at Evercore ISI. \nMark Mahaney: Okay, I wanted to ask Dave, I wanted to ask a financial question on the impact of AI and Gen AI. And I want to ask it this way, which is, as you think about the P&L impact of these investments over time and applications, do you think it's more likely to lead to improved monetization or improved cost efficiencies? And I'm sure you're going to answer it's both, but if you would lean more on one way or the other, which one would it be? Thanks a lot. \nDavid Stephenson: Thanks Mark. Yes, absolutely, it is both. I think it's timing. I think in the near term, I mean, remember that we actually use a fair amount of AI right now on the product. Like we do it for our party prevention technology, a lot of our matching technologies, while the underlying technologies we have, actually AI driven, it's not so much Gen AI, which is such a huge kind of future opportunity. I think we'll see more leverage in our fixed cost space. So needing fewer people to do more work overall. And so I think that that's going to help both on our fixed costs and some more variable costs. So you'll see us be able to automate more customer service contacts over time. So in the near term, I think you'll see, this is one of the things that we're going to be able to benefit from on our fixed and variable cost leverage. And then over more time, and I think it would be great to have Brian chime in on our future approach with Gen AI, would be how do we even make the service better for our guests and our hosts? I think there's a huge unlock there, but it may take a little more time. \nBrian Chesky: Yes, I'll just share a few things. I mean, I think, obviously as Dave said, probably efficiency in the short term, growth in the long term. Before I talk about the long term, let me just double click on one part of the near term that Dave referred to, which is customer service. So customer service, the strength of Airbnb is that we're one of a kind. We have seven million active listings, more than seven million listings, and everyone is unique, and that is really special. But the problem with Airbnb is it's one of a kind, and sometimes you don't know what you're going to get. And so I think that if we can continue to increase reliability, and then if there's something that goes unexpected, if customer service can quickly fix or mediate the issue, then I think there will be a tipping point where many people that don't consider Airbnb and they only stand hotels would consider Airbnb. And to give you a little more color about this customer service before I go to the future, there are so many more types of issues that could arise staying in Airbnb than a hotel. First of all, when you call a hotel, they're usually one property and they're aware of every room. We're nearly every country in the world. Often guest host will call us, and they will even potentially speak a different language than the person on the other side, the host, the guest and host. There are nearly 70 different policies that you could be adjudicating. Many of these are 100 pages long. So imagine a customer service agent trying to quickly deal with an issue with somebody from two people from two different countries in a neighborhood that the agent may never even have heard of. What AI can do, and we're using a pilot to GPT-4, is AI can read all their policies. No human can ever quickly read all those policies. It can read the case history of both guests and hosts. It could summarize the case issue, and it can even recommend what the ruling should be based on our policies, and it can then write a macro that the customer service agent can basically adopt and amend. If we get all this right, it's going to do things. And in your term, it's going to actually make customer service a lot more effective, because agents will actually be able to handle a lot more tickets than many tickets. You'll never even have to talk to an agent, but also the service to be more reliable, which will unlock more growth. Now, this of course leads to the bigger question. What can we do with AI? And I just wanted to offer a minute or two of thoughts, and I've shared this last earnings, but it's worth repeating. If you were to go to ChatGPT right now, and you ask it a question, and I were to go to chat GPT and ask it a question, we're going to get mostly the same answer. And the reason why is it doesn't know who you are, and it doesn't know who I am, so it does really go with like a mutable truth, like how far's the Earth, the  Moon, or something like that. There's no conditional answers to that. But it turns out in life, there's a whole bunch of questions. And travel is one of these areas where the answer isn't right for everyone. Where should I travel? Where should I stay? Who should I go with? What should I bring? Everyone of these questions depends on who you are. And so we're not going to be building like large research labs to develop these large language models. Those are like infrastructure projects, building bridges, but we're going to build the applications on top of the bridges, like the car. And I think Airbnb is best in class at designing interfaces. I think you've seen that over the last few years. And we can design, I think, a breakthrough interface for AI. I do not think that the AI interface is Chat. Chat, I do not think is the right interface, because you want to interface that's multimodal. It's text, it's image, and it's video. And you can, it's much faster than typing to be able to see what you want. So we think there's a whole new interface. And also, I think it's really important that we provide a lot of personalization, that we learn more about you, that you're not just a unanimous customer. And that's partly why we're investing more and more on account profiles, personalization, really understanding the guests. We want to know more about every guest in Airbnb than any travel company knows about their customer in the world. And if we do that, we can provide much more personalized service and that our app can almost be like an AI concierge that can match you to local experiences, local homes, local places all over the world. And I think the last thing I'll just say about AI is I think the companies that will best succeed in AI, well, think of it this way. Which company's best adopted a mobile? Which company's best adopted the internet? It was the companies that were most innovative, the most product-led. And I think we are very much a product-led, design-led, technology-led company. And we always want to be on the frontier of new tech. So we're working on that. And I think you'll see some exciting things in the years to come. \nMark Mahaney: Thank you, Brian. Thank you, David. \nOperator: And that does conclude the question and answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Brian Chesky for closing remarks. \nBrian Chesky: All right, everyone. Well, thank you for joining us today. I just want to recap. Revenue was $2.5 billion, that's 18% higher than a year ago. Net income and adjusted EBITDA were both Q2 records. And our trailing 12-month pre-cash flow was $3.9 billion. Now, this represents a free cash flow margin of 43%. We've made a tremendous amount of progress in the first half of the year, but in many ways we're just getting started. In November, we will share a new set of features and upgrades as part of our 2023 winter release. I'm proud to be accomplishing you too. And I look forward to sharing more with you next quarter.\nOperator: And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "ABNB", "quarter": 1, "year": 2023, "date": "2023-05-09 20:07:05", "content": "Operator: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining Airbnb's earnings conference call for the First Quarter of 2023. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations section of Airbnb's website following this call. I will now hand the call over to Ellie Mertz, VP of Finance. Please go ahead.\nEllie Mertz: Good afternoon, and welcome to Airbnb's First Quarter of 2023 Earnings Call. Thank you for joining us today. On the call today, we have Airbnb's Co-Founder and CEO, Brian Chesky; and our Chief Financial Officer, Dave Stephenson.  Earlier today, we issued a Shareholder Letter with our financial results and commentary for our first quarter of 2023. These items were also posted on the Investor Relations section of Airbnb's website. During the call, we'll make brief opening remarks, and then spend the remainder of time on Q&A. Before I turn it over to Brian, I would like to remind everyone that we'll be making forward-looking statements on this call that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described under Forward-looking Statements in our Shareholder Letter and in our most recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained on this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. You should be aware that these statements should be considered estimates only and are not a guarantee of future performance. Also during this call, we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures. We provided reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in the Shareholder Letter posted to our IR website. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP results. With that, I will pass the call to Brian.\nBrian Chesky: All right. All right. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining. I'm excited to share our Q1 results with you now. We had a strong start to 2023. We had over 120 million Nights and Experiences Booked in Q1. This was a record high [Technical Difficulty] change. Our revenue increased 24% year-over-year. Net income was $117 million, making this our most profitable Q1 on a GAAP basis. And free cash flow for the quarter was $1.6 billion. In fact, on a trailing 12-month basis, our free cash flow was $3.8 billion. This represented a trailing 12-month free cash flow margin of 44%. Because of our strong balance sheet, we were able to repurchase $2 billion of our stock in the last 9 months. And today, we're pleased to announce that our Board just approved a new repurchase authorization for up to $2.5 billion of our Class A common stock. Now during the quarter, we saw a number of really positive business trends. First, more guests are traveling on Airbnb than ever before. Knights and Experiences Booked increased 19% in Q1 compared to a year ago, and we've seen our highest number of active bookers ever despite continued macroeconomic uncertainties. During the quarter, we also saw guests booking trips further in advance, supporting a strong backlog for Q2. Second, more guests are traveling overseas and returning to cities. Cross-border gross nights booked increased 36% in Q1 compared to last year. Now we were especially encouraged by the continued recovery of Asia Pacific as nights booked in Q1 increased more than 40% year-over-year. And we saw international travel from other regions to Asia Pacific increased 160% during the quarter compared to this time last year. Additionally, cross-border nights booked to North America increased once again, with 34% of year-over-year growth in Q1 relative to 31% last quarter. And we've also seen high-density urban nights booked increased 20% year-over-year. Third, guests are continuing to use Airbnb for longer stays. In Q1, long-term stays were 18% of total gross nights booked. And over the past 3 years, we've seen new use cases emerge as guests across all regions and age groups use Airbnb for long-term stays. And finally, supply growth continued to accelerate. In Q1, we grew supply 18% year-over-year, and this is up from 16% in Q4. We saw double-digit supply growth around the world with the fastest growth in North America and Latin America. Urban and nonurban supply growth, in fact, both grew 18%. Now looking ahead, we remain focused on our 3 strategic priorities. First, we're making hosting mainstream. We want hosting to be as popular as traveling on Airbnb. And to do this, we're raising awareness around hosting, making it easier to get started and providing even better tools for our hosts. And our approach is working. In fact, in every quarter since we went public, we have seen acceleration in the year-over-year growth of our total active listings. Second, we're perfecting our core service. We want people to love our service, and that means obsessing over every single detail. Last week, we introduced over 50 new features and upgrades as part of our 2023 Summer Release. Everything we launched was based on direct feedback from our guests and hosts. This included pricing tools, transparent checkout instructions, faster customer service and more. And we also responded to input on rising prices, with the rollout of Airbnb Rooms, an all-new take on the original Airbnb. Now I'm going to share a little bit more about what will be launched in a moment. And finally, we're expanding beyond our core. We have some big ideas for where to take Airbnb next. We're building the foundation for new products and services that we plan to launch in 2024 and beyond. At the same time, Airbnb is still underpenetrated in many markets around the world. So we're increasing our focus on these less mature markets, and we are already seeing positive results. So let me just give you 2 examples. In Germany and Brazil, we rolled out our expansion playbook for accelerated growth. And as a result, we are now 2 -- they are now 2 of our fastest-growing markets. And this playbook has, in fact, worked so well. So we are now expanding it to other markets around the world.  Now before we go to questions, I want to talk a little bit about our 2023 Summer Release. Last week, we introduced the most extensive set of improvements ever to Airbnb, and it was all based on feedback from our community. We took a design-driven approach to perfecting our core service. We created a blueprint of the entire experience: every screen, every policy and every interaction with customer service. We then analyzed millions of calls and thousands of social media posts. And we hosted listening sessions with guests and hosts all over the world. And we mapped all this feedback against our blueprint and we prioritized the most common issues. And on May 3, we introduced Airbnb Rooms and unveiled over 50 new features and upgrades for guests and hosts. So let me share a few highlights with you. First is total price display. Guests told us, our prices aren't transparent enough. With total price display, guests can now view the total price with fees before taxes across the entire app. Second, new pricing tools for hosts. We heard from hosts that it's hard to use our pricing tools, and it's difficult to know what the charge. So to help our hosts set more competitive prices, they can now see other Airbnbs are priced in their area. And this includes listings that are both in high demand and getting booked as well as listings that are not. And finally, we also made it simpler to add discounts and promotions for hosts. And third is more affordable stays. Longer stays on Airbnb can be expensive, so we're doing a few things about it. We're reducing our fees after 3 months. U.S. guests can now save money by paying with their bank account, and hosts can easily set monthly discounts and offer more flexible cancellations. Finally, we also introduced Airbnb Rooms, an all-new take on the original Airbnb Private Room. Airbnb Rooms gets us back to the idea that started it all, back to our founding ethos of sharing. And they're also one of the most affordable ways of travel, with an average price of only $67 a night. In fact, over 80% of Airbnb Rooms are under $100 a night. And in the current macroeconomic environment, people want to travel affordably. But guests have told us that they want to know more about who they're staying with before they book. So that's why every Airbnb Room comes with a host passport, which helps guests get to know their host before they book. In response to last week and our 2023 Summer Release has exceeded our expectations. Press coverage was overwhelmingly positive, and we got over 3,000 articles. This is the most press we've ever had from the launch. On social media, our Tweets got 19 million impressions. It really went far and wide on social. But the most important thing we heard is that our guests and our hosts feel like we're listening to their top concerns. If we're not done listening, it will never stop improving Airbnb. So with that, I look forward, Dave and I, to answering your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. We'll go first to Eric Sheridan at Goldman Sachs.\nEric Sheridan: I want to come back to the Summer Release from a couple of days ago and come back to the concept of room. Can you help us better understand what you think that will do in terms of generating supply growth and coupled with it generating demand and new traveler growth to the platform as you look out over the next 12, 18 months?\nBrian Chesky: Yes, I'm here. How are you doing? Yes. So I'm very excited about Airbnb Rooms, because Airbnb Rooms is one of the most affordable ways to travel on Airbnb. We've been doing a lot of listening to guests on Airbnb. And one of the things they told us is, especially in this economic environment, they are looking for affordable ways to travel on Airbnb. And the average price of Airbnb Rooms is $67 a night. So it's an incredible value. And what we wanted to do is offer a product that we thought could capture this affordability segment that we think more and more people are going to be interested in, in this economy and also launch a product that will be very relevant to the next generation of travelers. Essentially, I wanted to launch a product that the 26-year-old me would have wanted. And we looked at our private rooms product, and we already had 1 million listings all over the world, but there was a bit of an obstacle. During the pandemic, people weren't comfortable staying with one another. And to get people more comfortable, we realized that we needed to help people understand the host they're staying with before they book. And so that's why we launched the Airbnb Host Passport. I think this is going to help a lot of people that are looking to save money and are interested in the local travel experience, be encouraged to stay in Airbnb Rooms. We also added new privacy features to understand if there's a lock in the bedroom door, if the bathroom is private. And we think all these different features are going to definitely help Airbnb Rooms. The final thing I'm going to say, Eric, is that we have a major brand campaign coming this summer, where we are going to be promoting Airbnb Rooms. If we are successful, I think this is going to bring in a whole new cohort of younger travelers, people that maybe weren't inclined to travel may now be able to travel and hopefully should list the overall marketplace for Airbnb.\nOperator: Next, we'll move to Justin Patterson at KeyBanc.\nJustin Patterson: So if I can, first, to follow up on Eric's question around the Summer Release. Brian, you recently made some comments about AI being a meaningful opportunity for Airbnb going forward. Could you talk about how that just reshapes or helps you reimagine the travel experience going forward and some of the initiatives you might lean into around AI? And then Dave, I appreciate you only give guidepost on the full year versus explicit guidance. Given the room night comp and expense shift in Q2 as well as the dynamic around new pricing tools in the Summer Release, could you help us understand a little bit more some of the assumptions that go into the second half and about flattish year-over-year margin?\nBrian Chesky: Great. Well, why don't I start, Justin, with AI. This is certainly the biggest revolution and test since I came to Silicon Valley. It's certainly as big of a platform shift as the Internet, and many people think it might be even bigger. And I'll give you kind of a bit of an overview of how we think about AI. So all of this is going to be built on the base model. The base models, the large language models, think of those as GPT-4. Google has a couple of base models, Microsoft reaches Entropic. These are like major infrastructure investments. Some of these models might cost tens of billions of dollars towards the compute power. And so think of that as essentially like building a highway. It's a major infrastructure project. And we're not going to do that. We're not an infrastructure company. But we're going to build the cars on the highway. In other words, we're going to design the interface and the tuning of the model on top of AI, on top of the base model. So on top of the base model is the tuning of the model. And the tuning of the model is going to be based on the customer data you have. And I'll just paint a picture for you. If you were to ask a question to ChatGPT, and if I were to ask a question to ChatGPT, we're both going to get pretty much the same answer. And the reason both of us are going to get pretty close the same answer is because ChatGPT doesn't know that it's between you and I, doesn't know anything about us. Now this is totally fine for many questions, like how far is it from this destination to that destination. But it turns out that a lot of questions in travel aren't really search questions. They're matching questions. Another is, they're questions that the answer depends on who you are and what your preferences are. So for example, I think that going forward, Airbnb is going to be pretty different. Instead of asking you questions like where are you going and when are you going, I want us to build a robust profile about you, learn more about you and ask you 2 bigger and more fundamental questions: who are you? And what do you want? And ultimately, what I think Airbnb is building is not just a service or a product. But what we are in the largest sense is a global travel community. And the role of Airbnb and that travel community is to be the ultimate host. Think of us with AI as building the ultimate AI concierge that could understand you. And we could build these world-class interfaces, tune our model. Unlike most other travel companies, we know a lot more about our guests and hosts. This is partly why we're investing in the Host Passport. We want to continue to learn more about people. And then our job is to match you to accommodations, other travel services and eventually things beyond travel. So that's the big vision of where we're going to go. I think it's an incredibly expanding opportunity. I'll just end by giving you some tactical things we're going to be doing in the next 12 months. Number one is customer service. This is going to be one of the biggest benefits to Airbnb. One of the strengths of Airbnb is that Airbnb's offering is one of a kind. The problem with Airbnb is our service is also one of a kind. And so therefore, historically less consistent than a hotel. I think AI can level the playing field from a service perspective relative to hotels because hotels have front desk, Airbnb doesn't. But we have literally millions of people staying on Airbnb every night. And imagine they call customer service. We have agents that have to adjudicate between 70 different user policies. Some of these are as many as 100 pages long. What AI is going to do is be able to give us better service, cheaper and faster by augmenting the agents. And I think this is going to be something that is a huge transformation. It's a bit all hands on deck, and used to be improvement later this year into next year. That's number one. Number two, we are now building AI into our product. And let me just give you an example. A few months ago, OpenAI launched plug-ins. And in fact, we were actually supposed to be one of the launch partners for the plug-ins on OpenAI ChatGPT. But I told Sam, we were literally one of the first to work with him that before right before our launch, I decided to pull the plug on it. And the reason why is I decided that the interface of pure tech space with widgets at the bottom was probably not the right interface for travel. Ultimately, I think the right interface for travel is multimodal. It's rich media. It's photo. It's video. It's much more immersive. And GPT-4 is available in our app. So we're going to be building GPT-4 into our interface. And I think that's the real opportunity for us. So you should see some big changes next year with AI built into our app. The final thing I'll say is developer productivity and productivity of our workforce generally. I think our employees could easily be, especially our developers, 30% more productive in the short to medium term, and this will allow significantly greater throughput through tools like GitHub's Copilot. So all of this is to say, I'm really excited on the short term and the long term. And the last thing I'll just say is I think the companies that will most benefit from the shift of AI are going to be the companies that have the most innovative cultures. That's kind of what happened in the '90s with the Internet. And if the last couple of years is any indication, having launched over 340 features of innovations, I think we're definitely going to be right at the forefront of this revolution.\nDavid Stephenson: And in terms of profitability, we're just really proud of the progress that we've made in our operating efficiency, right? We made some very difficult choices in the midst of COVID to rationalize and streamline the company, get focused, get back to our roots. And we made substantial progress in our profitability ever since, where we've done it. We obviously reduced our headcount by 25%. We've only grown it moderately since. We've made substantial changes in our marketing efficiency, continue to make good improvements in our operating costs, anything from community support to cost of payments to infrastructure costs. Basically, we become a better, more rigorous operating company overall. And that kind of progress has been great for us going forward because even as our businesses rebounded, we have stuck to our core strong kind of operating mode. And so even this year, as we anticipate moderation in ADRs, the improvements that we're going to continue to make in community support, infrastructure, cost of payments and our fixed cost leverage will be enough to offset any of the pressures that we're seeing in average daily rates.\nOperator: We'll go next to Mark Mahaney of Evercore ISI.\nMark Mahaney: Two questions. Across the online travel space, there's this dynamic of marketing costs being much more front-end loaded this year. Dave, any commentary on -- from your perspective, why that is? And then secondly, could you just double-click a little bit, Brian, on the Brazil and Germany examples that you talked about? If there's anything specific that you could say that you did that caused those to kind of accelerate up to become 2 of your fastest-growing markets so that we can think about how replicable those efforts would be in other markets, that would be really helpful.\nBrian Chesky: Yes, sure. Dave, why don't you take the first one?\nDavid Stephenson: Yes. Great. Thanks, Mark. In terms of the front-loading of marketing costs this year, it's just we're learning to operate better. I mean we had seen such great success in our brand marketing campaigns, strong return on investments in that last year. And what we learned is that we just felt like we needed to do that earlier in the year, get out even more ahead of our peak travel summer season with our brand marketing. The earlier we get that message out in the year, the better we can kind of reap that investment for the full year. So this is purely about moving up the spend on kind of brand marketing earlier. And to a lesser extent, but it is an element of it as well, is investing in some of these new geographies where we haven't historically had brand marketing, and so actually expanding that market into more countries. So our marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue will remain largely the same in 2023 as it was in 2022. It's just that we're front-loading more the marketing to get the message out earlier.\nBrian Chesky: Yes. And Mark, I'll just share a little bit about Brazil and Germany. So Airbnb is one of the most international companies in the world. We're in 220 countries and regions. And many years ago, we developed a playbook to expand internationally outside the United States. And that playbook included PR, included having some people on the ground, although generally, in many these markets only need that. It included a brand marketing campaign and made sure that our product was adequately localized. And it's just a really full funnel approach. And now we've added social media and influencers as well. So recently, over the course of the pandemic, we were not as focused on international expansion. And that's because we're mainly focused on recovery and some of the new travel segments like longer-term stay. Over the last 3 years, obviously, as you know, we've gotten really, really focused, back to basics and our company is significantly more profitable. Now we've done over $3.8 billion in trailing 12-month free cash flow. So we feel like now is a really good time to focus on international expansion. So we started with Germany and Brazil. And again, it was full funnel. It involved a lot of PRs. It involve brand marketing, bringing our marketing ad campaigns to pricing in the United States to these markets, localizing our product and working with local influencers. So it's a pretty full funnel approach. The results have been incredibly positive. These are now 2 of our fastest-growing markets. So we're now looking at bringing this playbook to other markets around the world. And I'll give you a couple of examples. Number one is Asia Pacific. We think there's a huge opportunity in Asia. We're massively underpenetrated. This is going to be probably the fastest-growing market internationally over the next 5 years. And the problem with Asia historically over the last few years is Asia market, as you know, is a very much cross-border market. And with the borders being historically kind of locked down and there hasn't been as much travel, the recovery in Asia has been delayed. Now people are starting to travel, and Asia disproportionately has a lot of young travelers. And Airbnb, as you know, is very popular among the young travelers. So we think Japan, Korea, China, India and Southeast Asia are going to be huge opportunities for growth. Next is Europe. We're very big in France. We're very big in the U.K. We're now seeing great growth in Germany. But there's a lot of markets in Europe. We haven't ever really run robust brand marketing campaigns. Now we're getting more aggressive in Italy. We're getting more aggressive in Spain, and we're now looking at other markets in Northern Europe. And I think there's actually a lot of greenfield in Europe because we've really only focused on a few of the really big markets. And when we see we focus the big markets like France and U.K., we are now really strong. And I think we can have similar penetration in other countries in Europe. And then finally is Latin America. We're seeing a lot of growth in Brazil, and we're now going to bring it to some other really large markets, like Colombia and some other markets within Latin America. So I think international is going to be a pretty big boom to growth over the next 2, 3 years. The one thing I've learned about Airbnb is no matter how different every country is, the playbook doesn't have to vary that much. It works quite well in every market. And especially, it works with Airbnb because it's very much a cross-border network effect business.\nDavid Stephenson: Yes, the playbook -- so I just don't want to leave the question without just reinforcing how well the playbook is working for us and that 90% of our traffic remains direct or unpaid, and that's been the case since COVID and continues to be the case. So this investment is working very well for us.\nOperator: We'll move next to Richard Clarke at Sanford Bernstein.\nRichard Clarke: Two, if I may. I guess the full year results, you mentioned how you control supply against the demand. I guess at this point, you're talking about supply growing at about 18%, but you're pointing to Q2 demand growing maybe more like 10% to 12%. Which one of those numbers is the right way to think about growth going forward? Should we be extrapolating the 18% or the 10% to 12%? And then just very quickly, you obviously shifted to showing the hold prices. Any impact you've seen from that? Is that impacting conversions? Is that impacting supply? What's been the impact of that change?\nBrian Chesky: Yes. Richard, why don't I start at a high level? I think our long-term growth is going to only be as strong as our supply. If we were to back out, what happened in 2020, 2021, as that demand grew faster than supply. And initially, this was a great thing. But the problem is when demand grows faster than supply and there's supply constraints, prices generally go up. And as prices have risen, while that's been good for the bottom line, affordability in this economy is a major issue. And so one of the most important things we can do to make Airbnb affordable is to make sure we have enough supply in the platform. And so a year ago, we identified supply growth as a major strategic initiative that we really needed to accelerate, and we created an initiative called Mainstreaming Hosting. The idea is we wanted hosting to be as mainstream as traveling. And we did a number of things. We said, in order to mainstream hosting, we need to make it safe, easy and cool. So we launched AirCover, which is top to bottom protection. No one else offers it. They're going to be set up, and we did some marketing campaigns for the first time in many years. We've since seen, as you know, 900,000 incremental listings. It's now accelerating every single quarter since the IPO. And I think what's going to happen is all the supply coming out of the market will keep prices from going up. My hope is that while the hotel CEOs have said, they expect demand to drive prices up this summer, we want to actually have prices moderate. We think that's going to bring in a whole new generation of travelers to Airbnb. So ultimately, I think that like -- that's a very, very important consideration of the marketplace. The more affordable we are -- just like Amazon, the more affordable we are with a wider selection, the more people will come to Airbnb. So that's the high level. Now with regard to total price, this is primarily a U.S. issue. But in the U.S., as you know, there was a bit of an issue where some hosts had higher cleaning fees. And we heard a lot from guests. And I think what the total price display is going to do, it's going to push demand to listings that are -- have an overall better value of a total price. And when people turn on the price toggle, we see that people are booking listings with lower cleaning fees or no cleaning fees. And I think this is going to have a really good practice in the marketplace of driving the demand to the best value listings, rewarding those hosts and making sure every single host remains competitive. So it's just beginning. We set a pilot in December. It's now available to everyone, so we'll have to see how this plays out in the coming months. But what my expectation is based on our release last week, we launched a lot of features around affordability. We have many more -- much more affordable monthly stay products. Hosts now have monthly stay discounts, weekly stay discounts. We allow hosts to set more competitive prices. We're going to continue to add supply. And hopefully, this is going to continue to address the number one request of travelers, which is affordable offer since.\nDavid Stephenson: Let me add two more points. The implementation of the oil price has gone really well. And what we're seeing is actually a neutral impact on our overall business. So the , which we've implemented, has worked quite well. The people that care the most about seeing it all in pricing, they can make the selection. And those who want to see it like other marketplaces don't even make that selection. And then the other -- back to the growth rates, 10% to 12% nights growth is not our long-term ambition. You do have to remember that in Q2, we have a significant hard comparison versus the Omicron, COVID variant that came out last year. Remember that people delayed their travel in Q1 and compressed a large amount of travel into the second quarter, which makes for a hard comparison of nice growth here in the second quarter.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Brian Nowak at Morgan Stanley.\nBrian Nowak: I have two. The first one, Brian, just to go back to your last answer about how affordability is an issue in the economy. On the Airbnb platform, have you seen any signs of trade down or shorter stays or price changes or lower traffic conversion sort of impacts of that more price-sensitive user on the platform yet? That's the first one. Then the second one, Dave, actually, to go back to your last answer as well. I think in the past, you've spoken about how there's a lot of moving pieces around the shape of the year, but 2022 was a reasonable way to think about the shape of the room nights or bookings for the year. How should we think about that now that sort of thinking through the comp structure and how the 2Q, 3Q comps are quite similar?\nBrian Chesky: David, do you want to take the second, and I'll get on with the first?\nDavid Stephenson: Yes. I mean, it has been hard to kind of perfectly predict the exact shape of demand. And obviously, Omicron has impacted the shape on nights demand probably more than the impact of revenue. We continue to see as the revenue guide that we have here is revenue growth between kind of 12% and 16% in the second quarter. And I think that some of the pressures that we're seeing there on overall revenue growth has, frankly, just been some of the elevated ADR rates that we're seeing, just higher overall kind of pricing, especially in North America. But some of the tailwinds that we're seeing for future growth in the back half of the year or a lot of the areas that Brian spoke about, things like continued acceleration in Latin America, acceleration in Asia Pacific and more cross-border travel. So I think some of those things are the benefits we're seeing in the back half of the year. Q2 is turning out to be a little bit tougher comp given Omicron last year, but we're seeing overall stable demand for the back half. We highlighted in the letter that we have 25% more bookings on the books at this time this year for the back half of the year than we did this time last year. So it just gives us confidence in people's willingness and interest in travel for the back half.\nBrian Chesky: And I can just take the first question, which is what we're seeing, Brian, is that people are most price sensitive, at least currently in North America, especially United States. And in the United States, the lowest price listings have the highest occupancy. So yes, people do want low price listings. And we expect that as Airbnb rates continue to normalize, and hopefully, our rates do not increase as fast to hotels over the next couple of years that we're going to see continued increase in occupancy for more listings in Airbnb and also is partly why we're so bullish about the prospect for Airbnb Rooms, not just to bring people to Airbnb that want affordable options, but really new travelers that have never really traveled very much before, especially Gen Z.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Ron Josey at Citi.\nRonald Josey: Brian, you talked about expanding the core. And I wanted to ask a little bit more about new ideas for products or the vision for the Airbnb economy overall. I think we've mentioned in the past the marketplace for local host services and other sponsored listings and other ideas. So any insights on sort of how you think about expanding the core and the vision for the Airbnb economy? And then just a quick follow-up, too, on just the experiences rebuild, that recent calls on experience, just talk to us a little bit more about how you feel that product is progressing?\nBrian Chesky: Yes, Ron, I mean, great, great questions. Just to kind of step back, before the pandemic, we were really already focused on expanding beyond the core. In fact, we had 10 different divisions at Airbnb. We added a Home division. We had an Experience division. We had a Transportation division. We had a Magazine division. So we had a lot of efforts. And then obviously, the pandemic occurred, and we had to get focused back to basics. And what we wanted to do over the last few years is before we work on new things, we wanted to perfect our core service. One of the great source of inspiration I had was Apple. And I remember in the mid-2000s, it was 2006, and Apple had not yet launched the iPhone, but how many of us wanted Apple to come out with a phone? And the answer is a lot of people. And the reason people wanted Apple to expand their phone is because they love their iPod. But how many of us wanted gateway to come out with a phone? And the answer is probably not many, because we didn't love our gateway computer. And so I think that one of the things I've told our team is we have numerous expansion opportunities, but we need permission to expand beyond our core. We need people to first love our core service. So that's why over the last 3 years, we've been focused on really perfecting our core service. That being said, our core service is stronger than ever. It's more profitable than ever. And I think we're now ready to expand beyond the core. So as we speak, we are working actively on new products and services. These new products and services are going to be shipping. Beginning next year, you're going to see a number of things ship next May as part of the 2024 Summer Release. And we're going to see even more things shift later in the year and the years to come. Now obviously, there's a lot of opportunities. There's guest services, there's host services. I'm not going to go into a lot of detail. You obviously will have to tune in to talk. But I think it is important to note that I think that the biggest idea Airbnb has are in front of us. I don't want to think that the biggest idea I ever had when I was 26 working [indiscernible] my 2 cofounders. I think that there's so much more Airbnb can offer. And part of it is just making sure we continue to learn more, build robust profile, build an extensible platform model, continue to increase trust in the platform. And then what we can do is go into adjacencies within our core, but then including that, expand beyond the core. So I think you're going to see a lot of new opportunities. With regards to Experiences, I remain bullish about the product. I think there is a massive opportunity for someone to build a huge product around Experiences. Whether it's us and whether we're able to execute that product, we still have to prove that. One of my great investors -- one of our early investors is Marc Andreessen. He said there's no bad ideas, just ideas that are too early. And a lot of life is timing and experiences. I think when we launched in 2016, it launched right like leading into the pandemic. It was probably early. I think the timing is probably now better. But we did as we decided, let's take a pause on new submissions. Let's retool the product and hopefully put out something that is even more relevant to this next generation that are looking for things to do. So I remain really bullish on all of this.\nOperator: We'll go next to Mario Lu at Barclays.\nMario Lu: Great. The first one is on ADRs. It came better than expected in the first quarter. You guys mentioned, India saw 8% growth. Anything to point out to within that region for its strength? And then is the full year growth still expected to be down mid-single digits?\nBrian Chesky: Dave?\nDavid Stephenson: Yes. On ADRs, it's been interesting how persistently higher average daily rates have remained, and that has been consistent kind of across the globe. I think even more particularly, the ADR rates that we saw in North America have been persistently high. So these are a lot of the reasons why we've been launching so many of the tools and capabilities that Brian has talked about on the call that -- and making sure that we're finding good affordability for our guests for things like Airbnb Rooms and getting tools for a host of even kind of price better. So I don't have anything more to say on that, except that we think that the ADRs, as we continue to see growth in Europe, Latin America and Asia, should moderate a bit here in the second quarter. And we want to continue to make sure we're giving great value to our guests. In terms of full year expectations, the year-over-year growth in ADR should be, I think, still probably down in that kind of mid-single-digit range. There's really no change in our expectations on ADR growth.\nMario Lu: Got it. And then the second question is on competition. One of your competitors is launching a loyalty program in July in the U.S. Just curious if you think that is a potential threat to the business since you don't have one? And any data points you can share with regards to what percentage of things are exclusive to your platform?\nBrian Chesky: I always believe that the best loyalty program is people loving your products. And if they love your products, they come back. And I think that's the reason why nearly 90% of our traffic is direct to organic, and we have really strong rebooker rate. So I mean we haven't needed to have a loyalty program to have really good loyalty on Airbnb because people really love the experience. And ultimately, I think it's just a matter of continuing to innovate. Ultimately, we're in the inspiration business. People want to have good trips, and the best trip wins. And whatever company is most focused on listing the customer feedback, innovating as quickly as possible and taking giant leaps and experiences, I think it's going to be the most successful. So we're really bullish about this. Now that being said, for years, we've looked at a loyalty program. And I don't think a classic point program, which is essentially a subsidy to buy loyalty is the right approach for us. But we do think there's really compelling, interesting ways to reward our very best guests and something we've been actively thinking about.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Nick Jones of JMP Securities.\nNicholas Jones: So you're adding a lot of great solutions for hosts and guests and the outlook comments in the release, sounds like this is contributing a little bit to some of the ADR pressure. So how do you balance the efforts to continue to increase supply, making it easier for supply to join while redistributing demand to available supply? Is there a risk of incremental ADR compression as a result of some of these efforts?\nBrian Chesky: Nick, I can start. So I mean, I think part of our secret sauce is our ability to really try to elegantly balance supply and demand. One of the great things we've seen is the marketplace has a natural equilibrium that it finds in itself. For example, the fastest-growing markets of supply are also turned out to be the fastest-growing market for demand. So if demand creates supply, what ends up happening is a lot of these individual hosts get booked. They start making a bunch of money, obviously. The vast majority of them get booked within days of listing. And what ends up happening is they tend to open up more nights. They tell their friends about it and then supply increases. But we've also found a number of tactics. In fact, performance marketing is a very important way that we balance supply and demand. Other companies tend to use it as an arbitrage business to buy a lot of customers. We have never thought of it that way. We think of supply performance marketing really as a laser, to laser in on balancing supply and demand in markets all over the world. And frankly, the more supply we add, the more we think we're going to have really great value listings that will ultimately attract more demand. So I think we're able to balance this out throughout the coming year.\nOperator: Mr. Kelly with Oppenheimer.\nJed Kelly: Just going back to the comment in the Shareholder Letter of your current backlog of nights being approximately 25% stronger than it was a year ago, can you just reconcile that with the 2Q guide? And how should we expect normal seasonality trends going forward? And then my second question, Brian, is you've done a great job with apartments and rooms growing supply in the U.S. Can you take that apartments' initiative and implement it in Europe and other regions of the world?\nDavid Stephenson: Yes, on the 25%, I mean, I think what it's doing is just demonstrating the strength in demand. I think what -- if you go back to the beginning of Q1, people booked much earlier here in 2023 than they have historically. So we had longer overall booking rates for the back half of the year. So we're seeing that strength. And so to the extent that, that demand just shifts earlier in the year, that's why the growth rate in backlog. And so it will be higher than what we are projecting for nights in any kind of given period. In terms of normalcy, I think as -- it's the specific percentage of backlog isn't a direct translation to kind of nights booked, but what we are seeing is strong demand across the globe and very stable demand in North America.\nBrian Chesky: And Jed, just to clarify question. When you say apartments, are you referring to the Airbnb-friendly apartment?\nJed Kelly: Yes.\nBrian Chesky: With landlords and they'll take offers?\nJed Kelly: Yes. Yes, can you do that?\nBrian Chesky: Yes, Yes. 100%, yes. We believe that this can be expanded all over the world. We wanted to use United States as a proof of concept. Obviously, that was we thought the first place to start. We started with about 175 buildings. We now have, I think, over 250 buildings. We have Greystar and some of the biggest real estate developers in America on the platform. And that's been our proof of concept. But assuming this works, and all indications are it is going to work. If response has actually exceeded our expectation, at least from landlords, then yes, we'd love to bring this to Europe, Latin America and Asia.\nOperator: We'll move next to Justin Post at Bank of America.\nJustin Post: Great. A couple of questions. I guess the first thing about competition. As you move into Europe, you might see a big competitor in booking. Can you talk about your model where you charge both the host and the guest versus there's more heavily weighted to the host? Do you think that works well in Europe? And how do you think about the differences there? And then maybe for Dave, on the marketing spend, it definitely seems like the timing is different. How do you think about marketing ROIs this year versus prior years? How should we think about that?\nBrian Chesky: Dave, do you want to take the second question first?\nDavid Stephenson: Sure. No, the marketing ROIs, I mean, again, I'm very pleased with our overall marketing strategy. I'm happy that our 90% of our traffic remains direct-run paid and that does great returns. And the brand marketing returns on -- that we've seen have been quite strong, which is why we're expanding into some of the markets. Also, the return on our search engine marketing has been quite good, and we're maintaining high ROIs there and making sure that where we have opportunities to drive incremental profit, we do so. So I feel really good about the investment we're making. I like the improved timing that we have here in 2023. And I like the overall approach to this full funnel marketing that Brian is talking about. We add amplify our brand and search engine marketing with things like social and PR, and we have that full funnel approach that works really well and that's kind of success we're seeing in Brazil and in Germany.\nBrian Chesky: Yes. And maybe, Justin, before I answer about our model in Europe, I just want to also add something. So with most travel companies, their strategy is like basically paid marketing, right, performance marketing and brand marketing. I think a callout I just want to make is PR social media is a huge benefit to Airbnb. Historically, we have the largest share of voice in travel. Last week, we got 3,000 articles. I mean that was like more than 1/3 of the amount of press we got for IPO. So we think that there's a lot of opportunity for Airbnb to continue to be front and center in people's minds, in PR and social media and even in pop culture on TV shows, movies, songs, et cetera, et cetera. So I think the name of the game is both paid media and then earned media. And earned media is a really important part of the international story and international expansion because earned media really creates trust more than paid media. Now with regards to Europe, the one thing I just want to point out is we actually have both models. We have a model where we have a guest fee and host fee. We also have a model where we have a host-only fee. And host can choose, and we have this kind of choice for hosts, especially for larger property managers. Ultimately, especially with our total price display, I don't think it's a major issue for guests. I think ultimately, they're going to be looking at the total price. And we've not seen a major behavior change. I think, yes, they're most sensitive to total price. They're becoming more savvy. They're getting trained on total price. And that is partly why we moved our product towards an option of showing people total price. As long as we remain competitive, as long as we offer the best product and we offer the overall best value for the total price, I think that's ultimately what guests are going to care about.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. We'll go next to Stephen Ju at Credit Suisse.\nStephen Ju: So Brian, can you talk about eventual rollout plans for pay over time to other parts of the world like Brazil, given the propensity among users there as to use this type of product? And I guess I'll ask the Airbnb Rooms question another way. Between this and pay over time, it seems like you are in a position to expand your audience. So can you talk about how much latent demand you may potentially unlock with what looks like higher service levels to that bargain shopper?\nBrian Chesky: Yes. So I'll talk. One of the things -- I mean, what you'll notice is a lot of our updates last week were based on affordability. So we announced a partnership with Klarna, which is pay over time. we can pay in as many as 4 installments. I also want to add, we also announced a partnership with Stripe, where you can pay by bank account for monthly stay. This is really important because it means you don't have to pay for credit card to pay basically what is essentially rent and then also would increase conversion by lowering costs. So we're really focused. And a lot of what we're focused on is starting these payment services in the United States, kind of similar to Airbnb-friendly apartment. And assuming these partnerships work, no doubt we're going to be spanning these to markets all over the world. And you're correct, a lot of countries, people pay in installments more than even in the United States. So yes, Brazil end markets, emerging markets over the world, I think this will absolutely be a very compelling offering. We just like to get the product right in our more like established markets, like the United States before expanding it globally. But all indications are this is going to be very successful. Now as far as expanding our audience, yes. I mean, ultimately, the biggest market opportunity for any company is always the next generation. I mean the great thing about young people is more of them every year. And if you can continue to be the most relevant brand for a young audience, then you're going to continue to be able to ride that growth. And that's going to definitely be a boom for first-time bookers. And the great thing about young people is 15 years ago, I was 26, and my friends and I didn't have a lot of money. Now many of us have families and we're much older, we have more money. And so what we want to do is capture the next generation of travelers, and then they'll grow with us. And I think that Airbnb Rooms is a Gary entry-level product. It's a great way to introduce people to Airbnb. I noticed, for example, when I used to talk [indiscernible], he said that like diapers was a very important entry product to Amazon for families, right? You buy diapers and then I will see you need other things. This is maybe an extreme example, but I think Airbnb Rooms is a great way for new travelers to come to Airbnb. And if you think about it, between Airbnb Rooms allowing the pricing tool for hosts that price more affordably, total price, which should see the cleaning fees down and other discount products, I think we're going to have really one of the most affordable products in travel, bar none.\nOperator: We'll go next to John Colantuoni at Jefferies.\nJohn Colantuoni: Active listings has expanded more this quarter than the recent quarters. When you look at the profile of these new active listings, overall, how do these listings compare to your existing portfolio? What portion of the hosts are individuals, urban versus suburban versus vacation destinations, et cetera? Then on sales and marketing with front-end loaded spending on brand investments, can you just sort of walk through the shape of marketing throughout the year?\nBrian Chesky: Yes, Dave, why don't you take both, please?\nDavid Stephenson: Sure. I think we talked about the shape of marketing during the year that we are bringing in more front-end loading on our brand marketing spend, especially here into Q1 and Q2. So it's several hundred basis points higher in Q2 than it was in Q2 last year. And then for the full year, total marketing costs will be roughly the same as they were in the prior year. So I don't have much more to say on kind of the shape or marketing beyond that. In terms of active listings, I think this is what's been really continued strength in our business, which is that we are focused on individual hosts. And individual host were 90% of our hosts, that continues to be the case. The new host that we're bringing on because we cater our tools to the needs of those individual hosts, so that's making sure that it's easy to list. And we give them AirCover for hosts. They know that their home is well protected. We give them the great payment capabilities, the customer support that they require. All those things make it easier for individuals. And what's been great to see is that our mix of individual for -- and professional host has remained very stable through that. The other thing that's been interesting about just our listings growth overall is it tends to grow where we have the biggest demand. And so the areas -- as urban come back, our urban growth has been kept in line with that kind of growth. And so as we keep expanding and increasing our business around the world, the listings come right along with it.\nOperator: We'll go next to Doug Anmuth at JPMorgan.\nDouglas Anmuth: I just want to ask about long-term base if it kind of moves down versus recent periods. I know you talked about some of the changes in payments and fees coming up. Are long-term stays slowing more with normalization in the economy or really just more of a mix shift issue towards shorter stays?\nBrian Chesky: Doug, I think it's important to just step back and say that what we saw, even before the pandemic, was that long-term stays were growing, and they have been our fastest-growing segment by trip length. I think what the pandemic did is it probably accelerated some inevitable growth and there's huge opportunity for us. And I also think we're never going back to the way the world was before the pandemic. I do think there is some little bit of a post-pandemic equilibrium that you're starting to see. And we're also seeing a mix shift because cross-border urban nights are now up. That being said, I remain extremely bullish on long-term stays. I think this is going to be one of the big growth opportunities for Airbnb over the next 5 years. And the reason why is because people are permanently more flexible. Even bosses that want people back to the office, I think they're going to see incremental flexibility. More people going away for the summer, more people may be going away for the holidays. And ultimately, with AI, you're going to see an acceleration of people having more distributed and more global workforces. So all you have to do is believe Zoom is here to stay, to believe long-term stays are here to stay and that's what we're betting on. But the biggest feedback we've gotten on our long-term stay product was it was just sometimes a little more expensive to book long-term stay on Airbnb, because the platform was built for short-term stays. So we made over a dozen upgrades to long-term stays and a lot of more based on affordability. So starting with -- we now have a monthly dial for you to really discover monthly stays, which was really cool dial like an quick wheel that allows you to search from 1 month to a year on Airbnb. You can pay by bank account. This saves on credit card processing fees. You can pay over time. We have more flexible cancellation policies. So you now can cancel a long-term stay up to 1 month before check-in. We have new discounting tools for hosts on weekly stays and monthly stays, and we have many other upgrades as well for monthly stays. So I think we're going to see a lot more growth. And one of the big opportunities, I think, that we're going to see is more people starting to come to Airbnb to list exclusively long-term stay. People that have no intention of hosting on a nightly basis will host long term. Another thing we believe is going to happen is we think long-term stays could be a gateway to short-term stays. There might be a host that are uncomfortable hosting on a nightly basis, but they're used to having a tenant and they might go to Airbnb to rent monthly. And over time, we might be able to get them more comfortable on a short-term basis. So we think this is a really big opportunity for us. But I do think there is some normalization in the post-pandemic equilibrium, but I believe this is still a major growth opportunity for years to come.\nOperator: We'll move next to Lee Horowitz at Deutsche Bank.\nLee Horowitz: Brian, maybe circling back to the competitive environment. It strikes us given some of the numbers coming out of your large OTA competitors, and the industry has grown incrementally more than it has in the last year or so. Can you help us understand from your seat, if you've seen a change in the competitive environment over the last 12 months? And what your expectations are for how competition may evolve over the next couple of years? And then, Dave, can you talk about how you think about balancing margins and investments beyond this year, assuming rates aren't a headwind moving forward, it stresses that international investments are said to grow nicely over the next couple of years? I guess with this in mind, how do you think about how margins can progress in the coming years given your investment priorities?\nBrian Chesky: All right. Yes. Lee, I'll start with the first one, competitive environment. I think it's important to note that Airbnb is more than double the size. And most of the travel industry is only a little bit larger than they were before the pandemic. So there's been a major mix shift share towards Airbnb. I think we're starting to see some of the old ways of traveling recover, specifically urban and cross-border. But ultimately, we're really focused on innovating. We're focused on playing our own game, and I think that we're going to continue to focus on a few areas. We're going to continue the Mainstream Hosting. And we think we're going to be adding more supply of homes than any other company. Next, we're going to be focused on perfecting our core service. I think there's potentially down the road to tipping point, where a whole new cohort of people could be comfortable using Airbnb. The biggest obstacle to Airbnb historically has been reliability and consistency. As I said, the biggest strength we have is we're one of a kind. The biggest weakness we have is it's just hard to be as consistent as a hotel. But again, with AI, being able to supplement and augment customer service and with many of our other initiatives to perfect the core service, I think we can introduce a whole new category of travelers to Airbnb. And this doesn't even include many of the opportunities we have with younger travelers, with new markets and new products and services that are only on Airbnb. I also just generally would just say, one of the big guiding principles I have is to focus on the things only Airbnb can do. And if we focus on the things that only Airbnb can do, then in a sense, you're going to come to Airbnb and we're going to have a lot of demand, a lot of exclusive traffic. And Airbnb Rooms is just one of many examples of something that only Airbnb offers. And so we're going to continue to be competitive, but we're also going to focus on things that only we offer. Dave?\nDavid Stephenson: Yes. I think one of the things I'm really proud of is the ability for us to both grow and grow profitably and have very strong margins. I mean having a 44% kind of free cash flow margin is something I'm definitely very proud of.  I think going forward, just remember that we are still heavily in growth mode, and we're going to continue to invest behind growth for the future. The good news is that as I'm doing this year, we're able to continue to be very rigorous in our investments across our P&L, make improvements in our cost structure, buying fixed cost leverage and do all that while investing for kind of growth for the future. So what I think you should anticipate going forward is that we'll continue to have a profitable business focused on growth. And that over time, we'll continue to have opportunities to expand margins, but that's not my primary focus right now. Our primary focus is in investing for growth. And as you mentioned, one of those areas for opportunities will be to increase our investment in areas where we're significantly underpenetrated and seeing great success. And we highlighted a couple of those areas on the call today.\nOperator: And that does conclude today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I would like to turn the conference back over to Brian Chesky for closing remarks.\nBrian Chesky: All right. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Just to recap, we had a strong start to 2023. Revenue was $1.8 billion, which is 20% higher than a year ago. Net income and adjusted EBITDA were both records for Q1, and our trailing 12-month free cash flow was $3.8 billion and that represents a free cash flow margin of 44%. I'm really proud of the progress we made. If you look at over the last 3 years, how much more profitable the company's become, I think a lot of that has been based on our discipline and our execution. And speaking of execution, our product just keeps getting better, and we continue to innovate with more than 50 upgrades and features last week and many more ahead later this year. I'm proud of what we're doing, and I'm really excited for the road ahead. So thank you all, and we'll talk next quarter.\nOperator: And that does conclude today's conference. Again, thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "ABNB", "quarter": 4, "year": 2022, "date": "2023-02-14 19:05:24", "content": "Operator: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining Airbnb's earnings conference call. for the fourth quarter of 2022. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations section of Airbnb's website following this call.  I will now hand the call over to Ellie Mertz, VP of Finance. Please go ahead.\nEllie Mertz: Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to Airbnb's Fourth Quarter of 2022 Earnings Call. Thank you for joining us today. On the call today, we have Arrium's Co-Founder and CEO, Brian Chesky, and our Chief Financial Officer, Dave Stephenson.  Earlier today, we issued a shareholder letter with our financial results and commentary for our fourth quarter of 2022. These items were also posted on the Investor Relations section of Airbnb's website. During the call, we'll make brief opening remarks and then spend the remainder of time on Q&A.  Before I turn it over to Brian, I would like to remind everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements on this call that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described under forward-looking statements in our shareholder letter and in our most recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained on this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. You should be aware that these statements should be considered estimates only and are not a guarantee of future performance.  Also during this call, we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures. We provided reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in the shareholder letter posted to our IR website. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP results.  And with that, I will pass the call to Brian.\nBrian Chesky: All right. Well, thank you very much, Elie, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining. Before I share our results, I want to tell a quick personal story. As you may have seen, I've started hosting again. Last November, I listed my guest room on Airbnb. My listing is called Beyond the Airbed. And the run guests is a histologically themed around the early years of Airbnb. There's memorabilia in the walls. From the receipt for the original airbed to old photos and me hacking boxes of Obama Os and Cat McCain breakfast cereal. When guests arrive, I have welcome basket waiting for them. And the first night we make dinner together, followed by desert. We bake [indiscernible] Chip, chocolate chip cookies from my cherished family recipe that I got off Google. The next day, we tour the airbnb office with my golden retriever, Seltenova, and I tell the story of building Airbnb.  Now why am I doing this? Well, because I love hosting. Joe and I were the first host on Airbnb 15 years ago. And having guests staying at your home with you is the original idea behind Airbnb. It's been an amazing way to connect with people. But I also believe that companies that makes the best products make products for themselves. And Airbnb will only be as successful as our host. And the best way to understand our host is to be one.  Since I've resumed hosting, I've got new first-hand insights that have informed some of the new products we'll be releasing, including some exciting updates this May as part of our 2023 summer release.  Now before we get into our quarterly results, I want to recap the full year of 2022. While we're 3 years out from the start of pandemic, we are still living with this impact. We've also seen high inflation, recessionary fears and the war in Ukraine, all of which we're still dealing with in 2023.  And yet, through all this, people continue to travel, and 2022 was a record year for Airbnb. Revenue of $8.4 billion grew 40% year-over-year. And when you exclude foreign exchange, our revenue increased by 46% year-over-year. Net income was $1.9 billion, which marks 2022 as our first profitable year -- full year on a GAAP basis. And finally, free cash flow was $3.4 billion. And this $3.4 billion of free cash flow represented a free cash flow margin of over 40%. And because of our strong balance sheet, we are able to begin buying back stock last year, and we repurchased $1.5 billion in shares in just the past 5 months.  Now during the height of the pandemic, we made some very difficult choices to reduce our spending making us a leaner and more focused company, and we've kept this discipline ever since. In over each of the past 2 years, we've only modestly increased our headcount.  In fact, compared to 2019, our headcount is actually down 5%, while our revenue is up 75%. In every single quarter in 2022 outperformed past comparable periods. In Q4, net income was $319 million. Now this is $264 million higher than a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA was $506 million, which is 52% higher than Q4 of 2021. And we generated $455 million of free cash flow, and this is 20% higher than Q4 2021.  During the quarter, we saw a number of positive business trends. First, guest demand at Airbnb remains strong. Nights and experiences booked increased 20% in Q4. We had our highest number of active bookers ever in Q4, demonstrating guest excitement of travel on Airbnb despite evolving economic uncertainties. During the quarter, we also continued to see guest booking trips further advance supporting a strong backlog for Q1.  Second, guests are increasingly returning to cities and crossing border. And this is the bread-and-butter before the pandemic. Now both segments continue to accelerate while non-urban and domestic travel remains strong. Cross-border growth nights booked increased 49% compared to last year. High density urban nights grew 22%. And globally, we saw cross-border travel to all regions increased despite continued foreign currency volatility.  Third, the guests continue to book longer stays on Airbnb. During Q4, long-term stays remained stable from a year ago at 21% of total gross nights booked in Airbnb. And finally, we saw tremendous growth in our supply on Airbnb. We ended 2022 with 6.6 million active listings. Now excluding all the Mainland China listings we removed in July, we grew supply by 900,000 listings, or 16% compared to a year ago, representing an acceleration in growth in listings relative to Q3.  Now why are listings accelerating in growth? We believe there's probably 2 factors that drove this growth. First, demand to drive supply. Post or attracted the supplemental income that they can earn an Airbnb, which is often critical during tough times. Second, our product improvements are working. Over the past 2 years, we've made it more attractive and easier to become a host. Just this past November, we introduced Airbnb set up where prospective host can connect with Super Host for free one-to-one guidance all the way through their first reservation. The number of new active hosts recruited with the help of our super House increased by more than 20% compared to prelaunch. But we are not stopping there.  In 2023, we're focused on 3 strategic priorities. First, we want to make posting mainstream. If you're listening to this call, you've likely travel on Airbnb or you know someone who have. We want hosting on Airbnb to be just as popular and to achieve this, we'll continue to raise awareness around hosting, make it easier to get started and provide even better tools for hosts.  Second, we are perfecting our core service. We want people who love our service. And that means obsessing over every single detail, and we've listened to our hosting guests and based on their feedback, we're making a large number of upgrades to our service this year, including improving customer service, making it easier to find the right home and delivering greater value and much, much more. And you'll see more of this in the forthcoming in the coming months, especially our release.  And finally, third, we're expanding beyond the core. We have some pretty big ideas for where to take Airbnb next. And this year, we're going to build the foundation for future products and services that will provide incremental growth for many years to come.  So with that, Dave and I look forward to answering your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question today comes from the line of Jed Kelly with Oppenheimer.\nJed Kelly: Great. Great quarter and great execution. Just 2, if I may. Just one, can you talk about how your urban supply is trending and sort of some of the initiatives you're doing around apartments?  And then, Brian, you did mention headcount. In Silicon Valley, there's obviously a lot of layoffs. You're one of the companies that are growing, having expanding margins. So can you talk about like your ability to attract top tech talent to execute on some of the initiatives you just talked about?\nBrian Chesky: Yes, absolutely. Yes. So let's start with the first one, urban supply growth. Let me kind of first start, Jed, by just talking a little bit more about how we think about supply. The great thing about our supply is that the vast majority of hosts that come to Airbnb come organically, and that's because of our global network. In fact, the #1 source of host are prior guests. And in Q4, 36% of our hosts were prior guests.  And one of the other things we see is the fastest-growing market where we have supply is also the fastest-growing market we have demand. And I think what's happening is a lot of our hosts are regular people. And as they get more bookings, they tend to tell their friends. And so this network is something that has a kind of self-growing effect to it. Now in addition to that, we've been doing a number of initiatives. Number one, we've been focused to make hosting easier with Airbnb set up. And between that and a new campaign we've been running Jed called Airbnb, which is basically this idea that if you have a space, you have an Airbnb. Between these 2 initiatives, we've seen twice the amount of traffic to our host landing page, the landing page to learn about hosting. And then we also have made big improvements to making hosting easier.  Now in addition, you might have seen that last November, we announced a new initiative called Airbnb from the apartment. Airbnb from the apartments, I think can unlock a large amount of inventory in multifamily homes in urban areas, and we worked with Greystar and a number of the other largest real estate developers in the United States. We have 175 buildings in Phoenix, in Jacksonville, in Houston and other cities. And the response from landlords have been very, very positive. So we are seeing a lot of traction on urban supply. I don't know, Dave, if you want to add anything before I talk of headcount.\nDavid Stephenson: You covered really well because this has been a historic strength of ours has been kind of the urban part of the business, it's taken longer for that to kind of recover. It's now well above 2019 rates, and it's actually part of the areas that accelerated our growth in Q4. So we're very happy with where we're at with Urban. And as Brian said, the early days of Airbnb friendly apartments has been very well adopted, and we're excited about the potential in that part of the business.\nBrian Chesky: And just on your question, Jed, on headcount, something was really interesting happened. So obviously, in 2020, we had to make some really difficult decisions -- and we became a much smaller and more focused company. And the obvious result of that is that we got more efficient and more profitable. But there was a less obvious result. What ended up happening is we have fewer people in meetings and people can move a lot faster. And we concentrate all of our very best people and put them on only a few problems. And I think that's been an explanation for why the company has grown really quickly.  But also, I think it's made us a much more attractive place to work because it's much easier to get work done. And we have a general philosophy that we want the very best people in every field to come to Airbnb in every function. We're functionally organized. And I think that we're one of the few tech companies that isn't doing layoffs. We're not cutting. We're not freezing. We're actually stepping on the gas. But in our mind, stepping on the gas doesn't mean adding a huge amount of people, we're going to continue to stay really lean, but we're really focused on just really hiring in key positions.  And we -- and again, I kind of use this analogy that we're not building like a giant Navy, it's more like the special forces that's what we're focused on. So we've had a lot of success with talent. And of course, we're getting a lot of inbound.\nDavid Stephenson: Add to a couple of things. One is our headcount is actually still 5% below where it was in 2019. We have a revenue is 75% higher. So we're nearly twice as big as we were previously with fewer people. And I'd say the other is our Live and Work Anywhere approach, our approach to being very intentional about how we gather in person. We believe that actually working together in person is very important, just need to do it in a very coordinated way. So actually having people being back in the office on random days of the week is not very effective, but being -- doing it in a very controlled and planful way is respectful of employees' time and is more efficient for the company, and our employees love it. And I think that's also enabling us to attract great talent.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Richard Clarke with Sanford C. Bernstein.\nRichard Clarke: Two, if I may. The first one, just around, I guess, some of the changes that might come over the coming years with regard to the distribution landscape. One of your rivals is going to wrap their vacation rental business into a loyalty program, lots of talk around conversational AI and what that can do to the distribution landscape. So just any comments to whether Airbnb needs to do anything further on the distribution platform? And then second one, a little bit more preset, but obviously, it looks like Q4 was a very good quarter for take rate. Have you done anything in particular there on take rate to achieve that result?\nBrian Chesky: Dave, do you want to start with take rate and I'll end with distribution after.\nDavid Stephenson: Yes. With take rate, there's nothing in particular that we've done with take rate there. Absolutely, on a time-adjusted basis, the amount that we take from each night's day has been very stable. And so any variation in take rate of revenue over gross booking value is just variation quarter-to-quarter. So nothing on take rate.\nBrian Chesky: And maybe, Richard, just if -- can you just clarify what you mean by distribution landscape? Do you mean like the competitive environment or how?\nRichard Clarke: The competitive landscape, competitive environment with regard to distribution, whether you see any threat or increased threats from loyalty program wrapping around your competitors and maybe the conversational AI that's coming into various other search platforms at the moment.\nBrian Chesky: No. I mean, like, I think there's just 2 things. On the competitive front, I mean, we have a lot of competitors and a lot of different categories. But I think Airbnb kind of stands in a class of its own. I mean we're now in over used all over the world. We're not just the U.S. business. We're not just the European business. We're a global business. We're not just vacation rentals. We're also urban and [indiscernible] and off the grid. We're known as an affordable way to travel, but we also have a lots of offering and everything in between.  So I think we have a pretty unique offering. And I think ultimately, 90% of our traffic comes direct. And that's because we have something that's unique. The vast majority of our homes don't exist anywhere else.  And what we're really just focused on doing is we're obsessing over providing the very best experience for guests. And if we do that and we perfect that experience and then we do really great marketing, I think we'll do quite well.  The only thing I'll say, Richard, on the distribution front is we have some unique assets that most other travel brands don't have. Let's take PR. There were 600,000 articles written about Airbnb last year. Airbnb is on social media a lot and a lot of people are talking about Airbnb on social media. So we generally have a slightly different approach to distribution, where we think just continually innovating on our product is great. The best loyalty program is building a product people love so much they want to come back and you have to pay them to come back. And we just take a full funnel approach to marketing around PR, and we think of our general advertising as really educating people on new products.  Now as far as the changing landscape for technology, I'm actually very excited about the possibilities of AI. I think Airbnb will uniquely benefit from this. And the reason why it's because Airbnb is a fairly difficult product challenge, which is unlike hotels, we don't have SKUs. There's no representative inventory. Every single 1 of our 6.6 million listings are unique guests left more than 100 million reviews last year. And to parse through all these reviews is very glorious. And I think that AI is going to really benefit our long tail of data. And the fact that our search problem isn't really a search problem, so much as a matching problem. -- right? If there's like 50,000 homes in a city, what's the right 1 for you, that's less of a search problem than a matching problem. And I think that AI is going to be a really good opportunity for us. And just stay tuned for some developments there.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ron Josey with Citi.\nRonald Josey: Brian, you mentioned investments for 2023 and extending beyond the core, that's been a key question that we consistently get in terms of what's next. Any insights you can provide there would be helpful, maybe just is it building out the tech infrastructure? Or is it more sort of newer products that are coming down the pike?  And then I believe in the letter, we talked about 1.4 billion cumulative guest arrivals. And so I was wondering if you can talk more about the brand, the awareness overall and just that user mix in terms of returning users versus newer users.\nBrian Chesky: Yes. Awesome. Well, let me start with investments for 2023. So the good news is that -- though we're investing this year and some new products and services to expand beyond the core, I don't think you're going to see any material changes in the P&L. We kind of think like I started my in my 2 friends. We didn't have very many resources back then. And the great thing about Airbus business is we're essentially a global network. So I think that we can incubate new opportunities, products and services for a relatively low amount of investment.  And as far as what you're going to see, I'd say there's going to be innovations on the guest and host side. On the host side, our general principle is that we want to always deliver more value for host number charging. And we have a 3% take rate on the host side, and we've been giving away a lot of products for free, like AirCover. And we launched aircover for host 2 Novembers ago. NPS for claims, reimbursement claims has gone up 70 points, so it's been pretty amazing.  And our general view on host are we're going to primarily give away most of our product service and innovation to them. But we do think there's some opportunities for eco services that Host might pay for. On the guest side, we started very modestly. You might have seen that we launched travel insurance, which is now in 8 countries, and that's been really, really successful. But I think there's many more opportunities around the like services.  Obviously, Airbnb experiences is something that we're beginning to really ramp up. And I think you're going to see a lot more traction in that product in the coming years. And I think there's going to be just a lot more around creating a step change in new service level and matching people to the right homes and experiences for them. So that's what I would say. Services on the host side, services on the guest side, there's going to be a lot of opportunities to revisit some of the end-to-end travel opportunities that we have, and you'll stay tuned for some cool innovation.  Oh, I'm sorry, brand awareness, sorry. Yes, brand awareness. On the brand awareness, again, we generally try to -- as I said the last part, we generally focus on a full funnel approach. 90% of our traffic is now direct. It's sustained that since we went public, it's always been about 90%. We have extremely high efficiency on things like performance marketing. And generally, the way we approach our brand is that Airbnb is a pretty ubiquitous brand. So what we really want to do now is continue to invest in awareness around our different innovations.  And there are going to be 2 things. Number one, we're going to be focused on educating people on our new services and offerings. So for example, there will be categories we've been running campaigns around that. And people have viewed 500 million -- people viewed listings, 500 million times for every categories. We're also continuing to raise awareness around hosting. We're going to grow as fast as we have host.  Now as far as how much traffic is coming from new returning, I don't know, Dave, do you want to share anything about that on where branded?\nDavid Stephenson: Yes. I mean the majority of our bookings come from past guests, and it's actually been the strong guest retention that we've had over years since the beginning of Airbnb, that's been a powerful driver of our growth. But I think what's also interesting is that we've introduced Airbnb to millions of new users since COVID. And the performance of those new users, the booking frequency of those new users from '21 that we saw into '22 has been very strong. And so really pleased with the new users that we've been able to track that look very, very similar to the historic type of users that we've had on Airbnb.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with Evercore.\nMark Mahaney: Okay. Two questions, please. I know you mentioned that guess to host ratio, I think you said something like 36% or something. I imagine you've got cohort data that shows that the percentage of guests that have converted into being host or and additionally, our host is actually higher, maybe much higher. Could you just qualify that or quantify that at all? I'm sure that's a pipeline, but just how robust is that pipeline when you look at the cohort data?  And then just very briefly on China. Just on the China outbound, can you just remind us how material that was to your business back when back in 2019, so we can get a sense of -- I know you've said that the China outbound market will gradually reopen -- but as it fully reopens, how much of an opportunity that is for you?\nBrian Chesky: Yes. I mean I'll start, Mark. Yes. We've seen that third in Q4 2022, 36% of new available hosts who started out as guest in Airbnb. This is more than prior year. So this has been going up actually like year-over-year. So that number is going up. And it makes sense as Airbnb becomes more ubiquitous, but also it makes sense because a lot of people, they'll connect with a host, and they realize, wow, I can do this too. And the vast majority of our new listings are by individuals, not property managers. So there's this kind of interesting network effect where guest becomes host and then host becomes guest.  As far as China, we expect the recovery to be pretty gradual in China. We think the big prize in China is the outbound business. We think that there are going to be hundreds of millions of people that want to leave China to travel the world, and we think is going to be the best way for essentially Gen Z people to travel. I think they really want an authentic experience when they're traveling around the world. That being said, we are expecting a pretty gradual recovery in China.\nDavid Stephenson: And China kind of pre-COVID was in the kind of low single-digit percentage of our gross booking value. So it gives you some perspective of our opportunity. I think we think very -- could be large over an extended period of time, but it will take a while for it to be larger.\nBrian Chesky: And Mark, And just 1 other thing, yes, you are right that the cohorts are trending up. So for example, I think in Q4 2021, 33% of guests became host. In 2020, 28%. In 2019, 23%. So it is picking up.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.\nBrian Nowak: I have two. Just the first one, and I'll talk about guests and hosts. Could you just sort of help us understand a little bit how fast did your new guests grow in 2022? And how are you thinking about sort of new guest growth in '23 sort of talk about EBITDA margins? Or what's your first cut and how fast guests could grow this year?  And then the second one, just any update on metrics or quantifying adoption around unflexible or any of the other tools that you've rolled out to sort of better improve the load balancing between supply and demand.\nBrian Chesky: Great. Yes, Dave, if you want to.\nDavid Stephenson: Yes. No, sure. On the new guests, we don't disclose the exact number of the new guest growth. Like I said, I think the thing that I'm really pleased is that we've introduced Airbnb to millions of new guests since COVID and that they're performing similarly, not even stronger than kind of historic guests in terms of their rebooking rates. So I feel really good about the position we have for new guests.  A big piece of it is some of the brand marketing that Brian kind of mentioned earlier, is just making sure we have a lot of awareness of Airbnb, but just to also make sure that we're getting strong consideration of Airbnb as a true option for them. And again, in this last several years, we've been able to introduce Airbnb to millions of new people that might not have thought about trying us before. So I think that's been really helpful.  And I don't have a lot to say on flexible except that we have a very strong adoption of the feature that -- and we think that it's a great way for us to distribute demand to where we have supplied. And the flexibility features are a key benefit for Airbnb because we have this more difficult problem, as Brian mentioned earlier, of matching and trying to match the right guest to the right host and the flexible gives us the ability to do a better match.\nBrian Chesky: Yes. And one of the things I'd just say, Brian, is that we've seen a permanent like shift in some of the travel booking behaviors on Airbnb since before the pandemic. And a lot of those changes have endured. And probably one of the most pronounced ones is just is incremental flexibility for people. We noticed more people are searching with more locations and using more flexibility features. And even before we built these features, we were seeing people entering a lot of different gate variations when they were searching. And so we were just really responding to where things are going.  And I think where this goes down the road is there's always going to be business travelers and families that know exactly where they want to go and when they want to go. But I think the long-term game here is increasingly, we're in 100,000 markets, people have not heard of 100,000 places. So the name of the game is pointing demand to where we have available supply, and that's kind of a big part of our product strategy.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Lee Horowitz with Deutsche Bank.\nLee Horowitz: So maybe on ADRs, you guys continue to surpass expectations with FX-neutral growth that probably came in the quarter at mid-single digits up year-on-year. Would appreciate that looking at the '23 pricing initiatives and mix will impact your ability to grow. but we've seen underlying pricing continue to offset these mix impacts.  So when you think about 2023, why can't ADRs grow again, given the strength of the overall industry is supportive of pricing for you guys.\nDavid Stephenson: Yes. Thanks on the ADRs. Yes, we were pleasantly -- there's 2 edges of the ADR. ADRs were up 5% year-over-year in Q4, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Obviously, foreign exchange brings you down to kind of minus 1% when you bring back nights that come, say, from euro or our GBP-denominated nights. And what we forecasted for going forward is modest decline year-over-year in ADRs largely driven by changes in mix, right? People going back to cities, cities are accelerating more cross-border travel mix towards lower ADR regions. It's a double-edged sword, clearly for the financials. It's helpful to have the higher ADR rates because they drive greater revenue, greater flow-through and greater profitability. But obviously, also ADRs are 36% higher than they were in 2019. So it's more expensive for guests to stay on Airbnb and frankly, other places.  I think the benefit that we've had is that even while ADRs are higher, we're providing great value. right? The ADRs on Airbnb still can provide a great location, maybe a fully stocked kitchen, a washer and dryer, all the reasons why you might want to stand at Airbnb versus other alternatives.  And so as we look forward in the year, we just want to make sure that we continue to provide great value to our guests. And that's why we're building some of the tools that Brian's talked about, which are things like giving tools to host to make sure that they understand the prices that guests are paying and making sure that they are providing -- continue to provide great value to guests.  So then the other thing we're doing is, even as ADRs might come down modestly through the year through -- largely through mix, and maybe some through pricing. It's just making sure that we're being really rigorous in our cost structure to kind of support declining ADRs, which is why we anticipate our EBITDA margins for the full year to be roughly the same as 2022 in that the headwinds from lower ADR rates will be offset by our efficiencies that we kind of drive internally.\nLee Horowitz: Great. Helpful. And then one follow-up on supply, if I could. Clearly, the product initiatives are driving impressive supply growth as everyone by seller rates and you guys are showing at this point. When I think about how that plays through into 2023, is there anything that we should be thinking about that can keep you from maintaining at these elevated rates, particularly given the fact that you will continue to iterate on the supply funnel to make it easier for hosts to come to the platform?\nDavid Stephenson: Yes. Very proud of the continued growth in our supply. And we highlighted in the letter because it's super important that we do our best to get a -- have a balanced marketplace, right? If we get too much supply too quickly, then hosts aren't happy because they're not getting enough bookings. We don't get enough supply early enough, then guests are not happy because they don't get the kind of selection they want. And actually, what we highlighted in the letter is that we have grown our supply by 26% since 2019, and yet our nights and experiences booked have grown by 24%. So we've actually had a nice balance in that, and then I'm very proud of the fact that we've had 6.6 million active listings here in the last year and $900,000 more from the beginning of the year, which just shows the strength of Airbnb and why host want to come to where there is demand. And then we'll just make it easier for hosts to become host on Airbnb.  So this will be a forever journey for us to keep providing supply where there is demand. And I think we've been doing it incredibly well for the last 10, 12 years, and we'll continue to do that.\nBrian Nowak: Yes. I think we just say, look, I think we're I think we're building a bit more of a muscle to around this. And I think it's been a really big focus of ours. So whether it's the product innovations, the awareness, focusing on even building, supply in key markets. I think it's been a really great muscle the team has built.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Colantuoni with Jefferies.\nJohn Colantuoni: I wanted to start with the new pricing and discounting tools that you're rolling out. It sounds like the expectation is that they're going to be sort of a net headwind to ADR. So can you just walk through the strategic rationale for the new products. I assume it's about sort of improved customer experience, but it would be great to get your perspective on that.  And second, nights and experiences on a quarter-on-quarter basis in 4Q and 1Q seem to be back on trend with the historical seasonality we saw pre-pandemic. Is this sort of the right way to think about the trend in nights and experiences throughout the cadence of the year?\nBrian Chesky: John, I'll start. On pricing and discounts, let's just take a step back. Airbnb, we started 15 years ago. And when we started, we started as an affordable alternative to hotels. And I think that affordability and great value is 1 of the key reasons that people use Airbnb, and we have to continue to make sure that we have that value. And as long as people feel like they have the best product at the best value for Airbnb, I think we're going to deliver a huge amount of growth in years to come.  And so there's really 3 things that we're doing. The first thing is transparent pricing with all-in pricing display. In Europe, in many countries around the world, we actually do show total price. But in the United States, the convention for travel companies show a low base rate. And then when you get to check out, there's additional fees. But we spent a lot of time listening to our guests and hosts. And we've heard from our guests, it's not -- a lot of them want to be able to see the total price upfront. And we spent a bunch of time in December, we rolled out total pricing includes all fees before taxes -- Since we've rolled it out, the impact on our bookings has been neutral.  Now I know there was a lot of -- we did -- there was a lot of speculation around what happened to show up on pricing. But I think that the response has been very positive. And we chose a very specific implementation and implementation we chose as a price toggle where you can turn it on or off. The basic idea is if people to control of how they want to see prices but also the active can the toggle on helps people understand why our prices are changing and why they might be displayed different than competitors.  So again, the impact has been neutral on bookings in the short run, but I actually think the impact on booking in the long run is going to be very positive because it's just a better experience, and it gives people more control.  The second thing is we are now prioritizing better value listing in search results. So in other words, we're going to take the total price in the total price into account when we're prioritizing bookings.  And then the third thing we're going to be doing is we're building new tools, pricing tools for hosts so that they understand the final price that they're showing to guests. One of the things we learned when we talk to hosts, they don't know the final price guests are paying. And if they did, they modulate some of the fees.  I think in the short run, it may have some modest impacts on ADR, but in the long run, I think what it's going to do is drive a lot more demand here at Airbnb, I don't know, Dave, do you want to add anything or take the second question.\nDavid Stephenson: No, I think you hit on all the key points on ADR. We're not anticipating a significant decrease in ADR as a result of the pricing tools. We just want to make sure that we're being transparent and helping host make sure that they're setting prices that are appropriate for their listings. So I think that on the nights and experiences trends, we're finally beginning to reach a point where the year-over-year comparisons are much more consistent. And so I think 2023 won't look exactly like 2022, but it's a much better guide than kind of historic years. So we are getting back to -- you'd be able to use year-over-year as a trend line for your forecasting.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mario Lu with Barclays.\nMario Lu: First one is on the listings growth number, the $900,000 year-over-year. I was wondering if you could help break down that number further. For example, were most of these listings completely new listings or were a good portion of it reactivated say in urban areas? Just trying to see how this growth organic versus travel normalizing?\nDavid Stephenson: Yes. I mean the real thing about listings is think about how all listings work. In any given year, we have brand new listings, we have reactivated listings and then we have deactivated listings and some combination of each of those 3.  I'd say that the trends of each of those have been kind of up and to the right. In other words, I think we're showing improvement in fewer deactivations and strengthening of our new activations. And so the sum total of each of those is all contributing towards our growth, but I don't have any other more specific breakout to give to you.  I mean I think the other -- maybe the only other highlight I would give is it wasn't in just kind of 1 region, like we were seeing broad-based growth of listings around the world and then even by listing type. It was like 1 of the earlier questions about how is the listing growth around urban again, in Urban was 1 of the accelerating areas. So we've seen really nice growth in the urban where that comes back.  It just leads back to this marketplace dynamic that we have for Airbnb, which is we both work hard to get listings, proactively on our own and get them more organically where there's demand. and where there's not demand, that's also where you'll see deactivations or fewer listing growth. It tends to be self-healing over time.\nMario Lu: And the second one is on the lead time for bookings. In your outlook, you mentioned Europeans were booking summer travel earlier this year. So any commentary you could provide on just globally how lead times look thus far versus pre-pandemic? And any puts and takes to consider when thinking about the 20% room night growth is sustainable for the rest of the year?\nDavid Stephenson: Yes. We're really pleased with the European lead times coming up. Europeans will tend to book their summer travel here in the beginning of the year. and to see them booking even earlier on Airbnb relative to our historic rates has been really great to see. Just, I think, shows the optimism that they have to kind of travel this summer.  And then broad-based, we are just seeing a slightly longer lead time more generally across Airbnb overall. So again, I just think that shows a nice optimism for people feeling confident that they can book for their summer travel season. So I think not much more to say than that.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America.\nJustin Post: Great. I think you give it in the K, but can you give us the mix of Asia in '22? I don't know if you can now -- And then secondly, how do you think about the Asia recovery in China cross-border impacting results over the next 12 months?\nDavid Stephenson: Yes. The -- in the next 12 months, Asia is still recovering, right? Asia has still been down versus 2022 -- I mean 2019 and -- but they were the fastest kind of growing region in the fourth quarter. So we think it's pretty optimistic about the opportunity. And as Brian even mentioned about China, like the long-term outlook for, for example, Chinese outbound travelers is something that we feel very bullish on for over the long term. And in terms of the fourth quarter, APAC was 12% of the business in the fourth quarter.\nBrian Chesky: And maybe I'll just say that I think the Asia Pacific is a huge growth area for us going forward. And it's been a little bit of a slower recovery. And I think the reason why is Asia is historically more of a cross-border market. a lot of people in Asia is basically travel across countries. They don't have as big of a domestic market in any of these countries for the most part. And that's just been a slower recovery. But I think the one thing we've seen is that just means probably more pent-up demand, and Asia index is even higher on Gen Z travelers, which is a strong suit of Airbnb. So we're really bullish over the next few years on Asia.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley with UBS.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Chris on for Lloyd. Just can you start by helping us think about the range of outcomes for ADRs in the 1Q '23 guide? I guess as we kind of lay out your guidance saying that take rates would be very similar to 1Q '22 levels and gets you to, say, $20.7 billion potentially of gross bookings in 1Q, '23, and you assume maybe a slight detail on room nights.  I could get to a situation where ADRs are potentially flat to better. I guess, is you're talking to ADRs being down slightly on a year-over-year basis. I guess, is -- what would need to happen here for ADRs to be flat to better on a year-over-year basis in 1Q?\nDavid Stephenson: Well, to be flat to better would be if there's stronger overall just pricing? And if the mix came in differently, for example, maybe urban didn't come in quite as strong as or cross-border Latin America, Asia didn't come in quite as strong. So a lot of our ADR forecast for Q1 comes from the anticipated continued growth of urban, cross-border and regional mix. And that's why we're forecasting it down for just down slightly year-over-year. the implied take rate, it should be directionally the same as last year and maybe not precisely the same, I think you look back in 2022 and it will be a good guide for your take rate.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Got it. And just maybe 1 quick follow-up question on the product side as you guys were talking about really kind of expansion opportunities. How should we be thinking about hotel within that? Or should we be thinking about more of the expansion opportunities being related to the core business and experiences in '23.\nBrian Chesky: Chris, I would just say, I mean all of the above, I think hotels are important ways to fill a network gaps. I think people come to be here because we have something unique they can't get anywhere else. But we also have a huge amount of traffic, and so we want to make sure people come here to me they don't leave without finding something.  So I think you can think about our product a few ways. Number one, our core business has a huge amount of growth ahead of us. And so we just want to first perfect the core experience by making it easier to find the right Airbnb, providing better service each step of the way and providing better value. Next, we have a lot of emerging use cases. those emerging use cases are longer stays, obviously, which is more than 1/5 of our nice book. We also have experiences that we're really focused on and continuing to fill out our network gaps. And then finally, beyond just all those are obviously new products and services over the horizon. So we kind of have a very balanced portfolio of all of the above.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Kopelman with Cowen.\nKevin Kopelman: So a quick one. Given you have $10 billion in cash on the balance sheet and generated $3 billion in cash flow last year, not including the funds held on behalf of guests. Can you just give us an update on how you're thinking about capital allocation and share repurchases? And do you see a potential for repurchases to go beyond offsetting stock comp?\nDavid Stephenson: Yes. really pleased with our cash position, right? We ended with $9.6 billion of cash on the balance sheet at the end of the year. That is after buying back $1.5 billion of stock.  We have $500 million left on the existing repurchase approval, and we anticipate that will be executing early in the year. But clearly, we're also in -- still in growth mode like we are using this balance sheet to make sure that we can invest in growth for the business in the future. Clearly keep enough cash for potential M&A opportunities, which could exist. And then to the extent that we can return stock and cash to shareholders through share repurchases that will be our primary vehicle that you would anticipate this year.  We're going to have about $1 billion of stock-based compensation. We'll at least be offsetting that through share repurchases and -- but I don't have anything more to say beyond that at this time, but we'll continue to evaluate what the appropriate amount of cash is to keep and how much we should continue to return to shareholders. But remember, we are still heavily in growth. We want to be able to invest in the long-term growth of this business.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse.\nStephen Ju: So can you talk about the typical behavior from the new host when they're onboarded? Do they start making only a small number of days available. And as time goes on and they get more comfortable with hosting they maybe make more time slots available throughout the course of the year because it seems like we're really preoccupied with the total host number because honestly, as disclosed, but I'm wondering if the aggregate availability growth has historically been a number that's been much higher than the property host growth?\nBrian Chesky: Yes, Stephen, I can start. The general trend we see is that most people come to Airbnb with kind of more casual intent to host occasionally. Sometimes people come dara host on a one-off basis, for example, on this past weekend in Phoenix, we saw a really big surge of new listings for Super Bowl.  What we noticed is that over time, hosts generally increase the number of days available and they tend to get more productive every year. And so more and more nights get booked on a single listing. And then we also see a number of hosts add a second, third or fourth listing depending upon what markets they're in. So the general idea is that host get more productive, they eventually book more nights. Their ADR typically goes up as they accumulate more reviews. One of the things we recommend new hosts do is when they don't have reviews to start a little bit more affordably.  And then as they accumulate rate reviews, they can command a little bit higher kind of market pricing. And so those are the general trends we see a general uptick in ADR is to get more reviews and to build a reputation. They add more nights. And then occasionally, you'll see some people add additional listings depending upon the kind of segment they're in.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.\nDouglas Anmuth: I just wanted to circle back on your comments on EBITDA margins for '23. You talked about maintaining margins with the variable cost efficiencies kind of being the offset to lower ADRs? Can you just walk us through a little bit more on those cost efficiencies that you're thinking about?  And then kind of related, how should we think about marketing spending? It sounds like you're going to shift more of the brand into 1Q. Is that just driven by a pull forward in bookings or more of just a shift in your strategy?\nDavid Stephenson: Yes. The way we anticipate our EBITDA margins for this year is that one of the headwinds is this anticipated ADR decline that we talked about earlier on the call, and that the ways in which we are going to be able to offset the margin impact of those declines will be through fixed cost discipline. We're going to continue to grow, but we're going to grow modestly. So think of our headcount growth being in the 2%, 3%, 4% range. So we'll keep having very good fixed cost discipline.  We've already addressed marketing in a minute because we've already addressed a lot of the marketing reductions, but we're just seeing strong improvements in our variable cost reductions as well, everything from community support costs, cost of payments costs, infrastructure costs. All those areas are just important and ongoing efforts for us to drive profitability.  As I mentioned earlier, we're still in heavy growth mode. I am not in profit maximization mode. I have a long list of things that we can invest in to drive further profitability. But I know that I can also afford with our headcount growth profitability improvements that can offset the ADR declines, and that's what we'll be investing in this year. And then we can keep working on the other variable cost improvements over time.  And then in terms of marketing, we've had the major step change reduction in our marketing expense. That was actually a strategic change all the way back in 2019. That's proven to be incredibly effective from 2020 all the way through 2022.  And what we've seen in 2023 is that marketing costs as a percentage of revenue for the full year will be about the same as what it was in 2022. But what we are doing is shifting some of the timing. We're just getting even earlier in the year to make sure that we're getting our message out to guests around the world. So they're ready to kind of make their bookings for kind of peak summer travel season, which is in the summer.  And so I think it's just we're getting more efficient and effective at the timing. And we think bringing forward a little bit more marketing into Q1 as a more effective use of our dollars.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Nick Jones with JMP Securities.\nNicholas Jones: Can I go back to kind of the Airbnb friendly apartments. What does it look like to get property managers on board with this? And I guess, how much of the apartments that they're managing start to get unlocked? And I guess, what kind of runway do you see in these key markets to add on kind of meaningfully more property managers?\nBrian Chesky: Yes, I can start, Nick. So yes, I mean this new program is something that we developed because actually, we started getting a lot of inbound from real estate developers. And they started -- we started saying if we made our buildings Airbnb friendly, would it make the building more appealing, especially to young people that are moving to markets in certain cities. And so we did a partnership. We started with working with Greystar, Equity Residential, over 10 other companies, and we've launched. We have 175 buildings in like Houston, Phoenix, Jacksonville -- and the vast majority of these units are kind of -- we expect if they were put on Airbnb, that would be a typical kind of ADR. They're usually 1 bedroom studios.  The tenants sign a sublease to a fixed number of days a year, they can rent typically less than 180 days. So the whole idea is these are people's primary homes, and they rent them when they're gone. And I think we're going to get a lot of demand because there's a lot of benefits to landlords.  Number one, a landlord get visibility control around who's doing what in their building. Number two, they get a lot of free demand of people that want to lease their apartments. And three, they get a cut on the commission. So based on what we're seeing, there's been a lot of positive word of mouth, many REITs and developers are engaging with Airbnb. We think we're going to be able to send a lot of traffic to them. And so I think this is a program that's going to grow quite a lot. And I also think what is strategic to us beyond all the incremental apartments that unlocks is we're now developing relationships with many of the biggest landlords in United States. And if that happens, I think you're going to see leases generally being more friendly to Airbnb.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bernie McTernan with Needham.\nBernard McTernan: On margins. So 2 impacts on ADRs, the mix shift in the pricing. It sounds like mix shift is contemplated in that flat EBITDA margin guide for '23, but can you still achieve flat EBITDA margins if that pricing benefit does come out modestly of ADRs. And as a follow-up, just if there's an estimate for how much FX weighed on EBITDA margins in '22, that would be helpful.\nDavid Stephenson: Yes. On the 2 impacts, I mean, as you said, large forecast that we have for ADR moderation is due to the mix shift. Clearly, we want to make sure that we are giving tools to host to price effectively so that we have great value. We're not -- it will be -- time will tell how much change we're seeing ADR from those overall changes. I do have a fair amount of levers, as I said, over time, that I can pull in order to continue to improve the cost efficiency.  And if ADRs come down more, then I may need to pull a few more levers, but I feel confident we can deliver our EBITDA margin neutral in the face of whatever ADR headwinds that we see this year. So I think that's the main end piece. And then your second question again?\nBernard McTernan: Just if there is an estimate for how much FX weighed on EBITDA margins this year given the differential between where revenues are generated and where the costs are in the U.S.\nDavid Stephenson: Maybe we can follow up off-line on that. I mean it was a material probably several hundred million dollars, but we would have to give you the -- maybe we work off-line on a specific calculation.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tom White with D.A. Davidson.\nThomas White: Any color or metrics you guys can provide on how cohorts of guests that you acquired during the height of the pandemic have been performing over the last several months kind of relative to customers acquired pre-pandemic. I'm just curious whether it looks like there might be any meaningful differences when it comes to, I don't know, frequency, spend levels, repeat rates, anything like that?\nDavid Stephenson: No, the actual frequencies take rate spend rates have obviously been very consistent with kind of pre-COVID acquired guests. So we feel really good about the new guests coming on and having them look very similar to historic guests, and so very consistent.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Deepak Mathivanan with Wolfe Research.\nDeepak Mathivanan: Just a couple of ones. First, it's nice to see the supply growth, but can you talk about trends on the utilization side? I know you don't look at occupancy in a traditional sense. But any color on how the product initiatives like changing the search experience or I'm flexible from 2022 is kind of helping with utilization or occupancy on the platform?  And then second question, mix of long-term stays remains stable near 20%. How should we think about that for 2023? Is that a potential opportunity and an area of focus for 2023? What sort of product initiatives can you do to kind of take that mix higher given that it obviously helps with the marketplace balance.\nDavid Stephenson: Yes. Deepak, on the supply growth, I think the best measure to look at is you just look at the growth in supply that we had versus 2019 that we grew at 26% and our nights and Experiences book grew 24%, kind of largely in line -- we're not seeing any major shifts in overall kind of utilization rate that give us any concern. We feel like we continue to keep, in aggregate this nice balance of growing supply and growing demand, and we want to keep that relative balance, as I mentioned earlier in the call. If one gets out of whack too much than either the host aren't happy or the guests aren't happy. But I'm very pleased with the way in which we've been able to keep that balanced.  And then in terms of long-term stays, I mean, if you actually rewind the tape all the way back to pre-COVID time. Q1 of 2019, our long-term stays were about 13% of nights. By the end of the year, it was maybe 16% at nights. So I think 13% to 16%. Last year, it was kind of 19% to 21% or so, 21%, obviously, in the fourth quarter. So it's been elevated and fairly stable.  I think we see in Q1 this year is that we continue to see really strong growth in short-term stays and short-term stays kind of outpacing our growth a little bit in -- versus long-term stays here in the first quarter. So I anticipate it coming down just a little bit here in the first quarter on a mix basis, but it's largely just driven by the short-term acceleration that we're seeing and it's still remaining significantly elevated over 2019 rates.\nOperator: This concludes our Q&A session for today. I turn the call back over to Brian for closing remarks.\nBrian Chesky: All right, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. To recap, we had another record year in 2022. Revenue and adjusted EBITDA were both record high and free cash flow was $3.4 billion. I'm really proud of these results. And before I go, I just want to say how proud I am of our team. If you think about what we -- what this team has been through the last 3 years, initially losing 80% of our business, kind of rebuilding the company from the ground up and now just becoming a much more focused, disciplined company. This is a lot of momentum inside the company. And looking forward, we're already seeing some really strong demand in Q1. Consumer confidence to travel remains really high.  I think part of that is like no matter what happens in the world, people want to travel. And for many people, the office is now Zoom, the Mall of now Amazon, the theater is now Netflix. Travel is going to become a very important way that people experience the world this year. And so therefore, this is going to be an exciting year for Airbnb and for traveling all around the world. So with that, thank you all, and we'll talk to you next quarter.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for attending.

As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations section of Airbnb\u2019s website following this call. I will now hand the call over to Ellie Mertz, VP of Finance. Please go ahead.\nEllie Mertz: Good afternoon and welcome to Airbnb\u2019s third quarter of 2022 earnings call. Thank you for joining us today. On the call today, we have Airbnb\u2019s Co-Founder and CEO, Brian Chesky and our Chief Financial Officer, Dave Stephenson. Earlier today, we issued a shareholder letter with our financial results and commentary for our third quarter of 2022. These items were also posted on the Investor Relations section of Airbnb\u2019s website. During the call, we will make brief opening remarks and then spend the remainder of time on Q&A. Before I turn it over to Brian, I would like to remind everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements on this call that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially, expressed or implied, in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described under forward-looking statements in our shareholder letter and in our most recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained on this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. You should be aware that these statements should be considered estimates only and are not a guarantee of future performance. Also during this call, we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures. We provided reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in the shareholder letter posted to our Investor Relations website. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP results. With that, I will pass the call to Brian.\nBrian Chesky: Alright. Well, thank you, Ellie and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining. Q3 was another record quarter despite macroeconomic headwinds. We had nearly 100 million Nights and Experiences Booked, which is up 25% year-over-year. Gross booking value was $15.6 billion. This is up 31% year-over-year. Revenue grew 29% year-over-year to $2.9 billion, our highest ever. And when you exclude foreign exchange, our revenue increased 36% year-over-year. Now, we also had our most profitable quarter ever. Net income was $1.2 billion. And this is up $400 million from a year ago. Now, this represents a 42% net income margin. Adjusted EBITDA was $1.5 billion, also our highest ever and we generated $960 million of free cash flow. In fact, over the last 12 months, we have generated $3.3 billion in free cash flow. What our Q3 results demonstrate is that Airbnb continues to drive growth and profitability at scale. And even with the macroeconomic uncertainties, we believe that we are well positioned for the road ahead. Now why is this? Well, new use cases such as long-term stays and non-urban travel are here to stay. And this is because millions of people now have the flexibility that they didn\u2019t have before the pandemic. At the same time, we have seen recovery in urban and cross-border travel, two of our strongest segments before the pandemic. And just like during the Great Recession in 2008, when everything started, people today are especially interested in earning extra income through hosting. Now during the quarter, we saw a number of positive business trends. First, guest demand on Airbnb remains strong. Globally, we exceeded 90 million guest arrivals during the quarter and this is another record. Now even with macroeconomic headwinds, Nights and Experiences Booked increased 25%. And during the quarter, we also continued to see longer lead times, supporting a stronger backlog for Q4. Second, guests are increasingly returning to cities and crossing borders. Both segments continue to accelerate. Cross-border gross nights booked increased 58% compared to a year ago. High density urban nights booked grew 27%. And now even as these two segments return, demand for domestic and non-urban travel remains strong. Third, guests continue to stay longer on Airbnb. Over the last year, we have seen many companies require their employees to return to the office. And at the same time, long-term stay remains 20% of our total gross nights booked on Airbnb. And finally, four, our host community continues to grow. We believe there are several factors that are driving this growth. The first reason is the demand drives supply. For instance, in Q3, as guests were returning to cities, we saw urban supply accelerate. Second, since Airbnb began in 2008, posts have consistently churned Airbnb to earn extra income. In fact, since 2008, hosts on Airbnb have earned $180 billion in our platform. Third, over last year, we made several product improvements to help onboard and support our hosts, but we are not stopping there. On November 16, we are going to introduce an all-new super easy way for millions of people to turn to Airbnb their homes as part of our winter release. We are also delivering a major upgrade to AirCover that provides even more top or bottom protection for every host. Now with these upgrades and more, we aim to unlock the next generation of hosts and improve the experience for more than 4 million people that are already hosting. So just to recap, we had a record Q3, Nights and Experiences Booked were our highest Q3 ever, revenue and adjusted EBITDA were record high, free cash flow was $950 million. And in the last 12 months, we have generated $3.3 billion in free cash flow. So with that, Dave and I look forward to answer your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Lloyd Walmsley at UBS.\nLloyd Walmsley: Thanks. Two, if I can. First, just the classic kind of macro question, anything you guys are seeing globally, any pockets where you are seeing weaker trends in bookings or ADRs that would be kind of early warning sign that you would flag heading into next year? And then second one you guys have talked a little bit about starting to invest again in Experiences. I guess if we step back, how should we think about the cost growth outlook heading into 2023? And are you \u2013 is there anything you are doing in light of just questions around macro to kind of keep a lid on costs heading into next year? Thanks.\nBrian Chesky: Alright. Thanks, Lloyd. Dave, why don\u2019t I answer these and then you can go at a high level and you can go specifically into the booking side question. But Lloyd, what I am going to do is I\u2019ll answer it at a little more of a high level. So one of the things that we have seen is, despite a lot of consumers pulling back on spending, the one area that I haven\u2019t seen them pullback on as much is travel. And in particular, like travel, where you can go and see your friends, see your family, more inspirational type of travel, in other words, meaningful travel and not just mass travel. And I think the reason why is just because many people are now working from home, the mall is now Amazon. The movie theater is now Netflix, people still want to get out of their house. They still want to have memories. They still want to have meaningful experiences. And I think that\u2019s why they continue to turn to Airbnb. And so just like people continue to travel this quarter, we expect really strong demand for Airbnb next year. And again, the new use cases are sticking. In other words, a fifth of our nights booked are for longer than a month and half of our nights booked are longer than a week. And this has basically been a boon because of the flexibility that people have and being able to essentially work from home or have a hybrid work lifestyle. At the same time, our urban and cross-border businesses are incredibly strong because of the value that we provide. And we think that value and having great deals is going to be a key driver as the economy slows down. On the supply side, I just would remind everyone that we started Airbnb in 2008 during the Great Recession. And at that time, many people were turning to Airbnb to earn extra income. And so we think this will be also a great time for millions of people to consider hosting, which is why we are focused on this on November 16. So we are feeling really positive about the path forward. With regards to Experiences, to answer your question very simply, the great thing about Experiences is we don\u2019t have to have very much incremental investment to make this work. It\u2019s really just a matter of incorporating Experiences more into our existing marketing and incorporating Experiences more into our existing products. So I don\u2019t think you will see that in the P&L from a cost perspective next year at all. Dave, feel free to take \u2013 anything else you want to add.\nDave Stephenson: No, I will just double click in a few areas. We are just doing incredibly well despite the macroeconomic environment. We saw continued strength in Q3. The Q3 nights experiences grew 25% year-over-year and our revenue grew 29% year-over-year. And as we stated, it\u2019s actually 36% growth year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. And what we are seeing in Q4 is not seeing any overall changes in booking behaviors from our guests. 4 weeks in this quarter, we are seeing really strong promising trends in cross-border, renewed interest in urban stays, stabilizing cancellations and just strong future bookings. And that we included in our guidance here. On our guidance for Q4, we are anticipating revenue growth between 17% and 23%. And that\u2019s 23% to 29%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. And maybe I will just take a minute to double click here, because one of the things we are seeing is the difference in the behavior that we had last year. If you actually go back to 2019 at historic rates, we are actually seeing stable to increasing demand for bookings here from Q3 into Q4. The decel that we see from Q3 into Q4 is really a hard comp on Q4 last year, where we had really strong demand after Delta and before Omicron. And so this is really kind of a hard year-over-year comp. And if you go back and compare back to 2019, we are seeing stable to increasing demand across the globe. And have actually aimed areas to highlight and you see it in our letter, is that APAC had some of the stronger growth, 65% growth in APAC. And excluding China, APAC is now kind of above 2019 level. So, that\u2019s been kind of the last major region to kind of return to 2019.\nLloyd Walmsley: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: We will move next to Naved Khan at Truist Securities.\nNaved Khan: Yes, thanks a lot. Is there anything worth calling out in terms of incremental demand for European sales from travelers outside of Europe, given the decline in the currencies in that area? And then the other question I had is just on advertising, can you share anything in terms of ROI on the advertising dollars? And are you seeing more opportunities to deploy these more broadly?\nBrian Chesky: Yes, Naved. Why don\u2019t Dave \u2013 you take these, I can round out the answers.\nDave Stephenson: Sure. In terms of European demand, we are seeing strong European demand from places like the U.S., where the dollar is stronger than the euro. It\u2019s not a material part of the business. It\u2019s hard to see it impact the overall materiality given just the size of our business being in 220 countries and regions around the world. And conversely, the European travel is going to be maybe less likely to come say to the U.S. where the U.S. dollar is so strong. So there is some offset in there. Overall, the impact of foreign exchange isn\u2019t as large on the business because of the regional impacts. More people kind of travel either domestically or within their own regions. And then in terms of advertising ROI, we are really pleased with our approach to the marketing strategy that we have had. Our brand marketing results are delivering excellent results overall with a strong rate of return. And it\u2019s been so successful that we are actually expanding to more countries. And so that\u2019s what you will be still be seeing over the course of this next year is to expand more countries to support our brand advertising.\nNaved Khan: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Nick Jones at JMP Securities.\nNick Jones: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess first, I guess when we look at kind of U.S. to international travel, is the strength in U.S. dollar maybe helping drive more interest in going overseas? And then the second question on durability of kind of ADRs, as elevated home prices may be making host less likely to lower the rate at which they are willing to take kind of from here. I mean, are these going to be maybe more durable than we think? Thanks.\nBrian Chesky: Dave, why don\u2019t you take the first question, I can take the second.\nDave Stephenson: Yes. Again, as I just said, on the U.S. international, we clearly do have a strong U.S. dollar, which enables Americans to travel abroad quite well and we are seeing nice strength there. And again, that part of the business is not so large as to have a material impact on the overall business, because you also have some of the offsets of weaker currencies, not necessarily travel in the U.S. Again, more of the travel is domestic and intra-regional, that\u2019s what\u2019s really going to kind of drive things and more of the foreign exchange issues are not as pronounced within the given region.\nBrian Chesky: And I think just regarding elevated home prices and what that does to average daily rate on Airbnb, I mean just to zoom out, people come to Airbnb because they can find a great value. And you can often get significantly more for your money than a hotel room. You can often get an entire home with a lot of amenities. And continuing to deliver value is going to be really important for the next travel season. And that means that we need to make sure we have really competitive prices. And that means that we need to give tools for host, more tools for them to be able to better price their listings. So, one of the things we are doing is we are going to continue to move towards a more all-in pricing, where when you see pricing, instead of seeing more of a nightly rate, you are going to see a little bit more of a fully loaded rate. And then our search ranking is going to prioritize great value, great deal for the fully loaded price. I think this will really help host understand what they are charging and then we are going to give them more tools so they can see and understand what their all-in pricing is for guests and we are going to provide more discount tools and other features to allow hosts to remain competitive. And if we do all these things, I believe we will be even more competitive from a pricing standpoint than we are today.\nNick Jones: Great. Thanks, Brian.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Brian Fitzgerald at Wells Fargo.\nBrian Fitzgerald: Thanks, guys. I think you will have more to say about supply with the upcoming winter release, but just wondering if you could talk about what you see as continuing pain points for host, Brian, maybe you just talk to that a little bit and maybe also structural drivers around supply like local regulations and zoning? Thanks.\nBrian Chesky: Yes, yes. So let me dive into this, because this is a pretty important topic. Just to zoom out, we have a global network where demand drives supply. And that means that where we see our highest growth of bookings is also typically where we see our highest growth of supply. And just to give you an example, this past quarter, approximately 35% of our new available hosts had started as guests. So this is a really strong network where guests become host and the host as they get more bookings, they tend to tell their friends about it, and then we get more supply that way. And so this is, I think, one of the things that\u2019s really, really important. But beyond that, obviously, we want to be very aggressive about recruiting more hosts to Airbnb, because this is a great time. And because of the softening economy, we think increasingly now more than ever before, people are interested in putting their homes on Airbnb to make supplemental income. So to answer your question, what are the pain points? I would highlight too, as we\u2019ve talked to people that are considering hosting, they have told us two things. The first thing they said is that they want it to be easier to get started. They need help getting started becoming a host. The second thing is they are a little nervous about having strangers in their house. And so we have tackled both of these. On November 16, as part of our winter release, number one, we are going to unveil an all new super easy way for millions of people to put their home on Airbnb. I am pretty excited about this. We have been working on this for quite a while. Second, to make people feel comfortable about having other people in their home, which will unlock a lot more everyday people putting their real homes on Airbnb, we are going to be providing some huge upgrades and improvements to AirCover for host. If we do these two things, I think we are going to help unlock significantly greater amounts of supply, which is already on top of the momentum that we have and we have seen in Q3. Maybe the final thing I\u2019ll just say is in addition to adding more supply in Airbnb, the Holy Grail is pointing demand to where we have supply, because I know night globally on Airbnb, are we ever close to 100% occupied. It\u2019s just a matter of pointing demand to where we have supply. And this is the whole theory around Airbnb categories that instead of hoping people type in the place you have available supply in the search box, you can then come and have more of a browse experience where we highlight homes that are available. So this is our holistic strategy. As far as pain points, as far as like from a regulatory standpoint, I mean, one of the things we\u2019ve seen is a redistribution away from very large city kind of to everywhere. And a lot of cities and a lot of local communities have been actually reaching out to us, because they can see the economic opportunity we provide. So we are working really, really closely with these markets, but we are feeling very optimistic about our supply for 2023.\nDave Stephenson: Let me just double click it too on a couple of Brian\u2019s points, because I think they are really important because of these partnerships that we\u2019ve had with local governments, especially on tax collection, we have delivered more than $6 billion in tourism-related taxes to local governments. I mean, this is a material amount of money. And collecting \u2013 remitting taxes, we do it in over 30,000 jurisdictions around the globe. And I think in terms of like zoning regulations, we believe that the reasonable regulation actually normalizes hosting. And when you normalize hosting, it can really be a foundation for future growth. So we actually think that you do this in a reasonable way, and it will actually be a tailwind to growth in the future.\nBrian Fitzgerald: Got it. Thanks, guys. \nOperator: Next, we will move to Brian Nowak at Morgan Stanley.\nBrian Nowak: Thanks for taking my question. I have two. The first one, just to maybe try to cut the business a little bit different way. What can you tell us about sort of your growth in active bookers or stairs versus spend per booker that\u2019s sort of driving the business right now? And how have those cohorts that came in during COVID, how have they aged versus COVID which is cohorts you had prior to COVID. And then the second one, Brian, you made so many improvements to the platform over the years from unflexible and trying to load balance supply and demand, etcetera. What can you tell us about the conversion of traffic now versus where it was, say, in 2019?\nBrian Chesky: Alright. Yes, Dave, do you want to take the first question?\nDave Stephenson: Yes, in terms of the active bookers, I think you kind of step back and look at the marketing approach that we\u2019ve had since pre COVID and that we really has accelerated in COVID in sense has been to continue to focus on the overall brand of Airbnb and to be less reliant on search engine marketing. We\u2019ve been incredibly effective at that 90% of our traffic remains direct or unpaid which is driving a great return on investment for kind of new active bookers. And so I think the return that we\u2019re getting on new has been quite good. And in terms of the cohorts of new, we\u2019re actually seeing that the cohorts that are coming in since COVID are actually as strong, if not even stronger than they were in prior to COVID. The people that are willing to kind of travel right now and experience Airbnb have are really sticky, and the cohorts are as strong and not stronger than we saw previously.\nOperator: We will go next to the...\nBrian Chesky: Alright. Sorry, sorry, I just want to answer about conversion of traffic for unflexible. So yes, at a high level, conversion on a year-over-year basis is up. But I would actually generally say, Brian, that we actually think about it even more broadly. When we launch Airbnb Categories, for example, one of the goals was not just increased conversion, but was actually to increase traffic. And there is a scenario where you can increase traffic, initially conversion can go down because you are a little bit more in the inspiration business. And there were people who are coming and they are dreaming and planning travel. So you really want to look at conversion over a longer period of time. But we have actually seen metronomic improvement in our conversion rate. But stays listings in Airbnb Categories since we launched on May 11 have been viewed more than 300 million times and with homes they would have never otherwise have known existed. So we are really excited about the progress we\u2019re making between Airbnb Categories, which is really bringing a lot more traffic to Airbnb, plenty demand were half supply, bringing us top of funnel. There would be AirCover for guests, which is making people feel more assured about their experience and allowing a more consistent form of reliability. I think that we\u2019re going to continue to see a step change in improvement in the product from a guest experience. And this, of course, will continue to lead to greater conversion.\nBrian Nowak: Great. Thank you, both.\nOperator: We will go next to Doug Anmuth from JPMorgan.\nDoug Anmuth: Thanks for taking the questions. I have two. First, Brian, I know you talked about strong growth in new hosts and a lot of them seeing new income opportunities. But within that, is the macro environment and interest rates, is that putting any pressure on second homes in your view? And then secondly, if you could talk a little bit about the early returns on the spring update categories. Is there anything you can add just around conversion rates or what you might be seeing in incremental bookings? Thanks.\nBrian Chesky: Yes, Doug, I mean, I\u2019ll let Dave fill in, in more detail. But at the highest level, I think it\u2019s actually pretty simple. In \u2013 as the economy slows down, I think people are looking for more ways to make either supplemental income or like greater yield on the assets they have. And so we generally see a selling economy as a moment when more and more people are going to be presumably turning to Airbnb for hosting. And so whether it\u2019s second homes or primary homes, I think there is going to be a pretty big opportunity for us. And we just want to make sure that we provide great tools for people so they continue to lift on Airbnb. As far as some of the metrics we\u2019ve seen, again, as I said, conversion has steadily picked up. Homes and Airbnb experiences have been viewed more than 300 million times. We\u2019re seeing us continue to spread out bookings to more and more markets, which is a bit of the Holy Grail to be on the point demand we have supply. With AirCover for guests, which is another very important upgrade that we made because this is AirCover for guests really addresses a bit of the chilly fuel of Airbnb, which is on the one hand, we have this incredible one-of-a-kind homes. Other hand, one of a kind can be variable in consistency. And so what we\u2019ve seen with AirCover is we provide protection in the unlikely event that a host cancels or you get to a home and it\u2019s not as described. And we\u2019ve seen since we\u2019ve launched AirCover for guests, NPS is up and probably even more importantly, rebooking rates when I guess it dissatisfied is also up. And so if we can do these two things: on the front end, continue to be more in the inspiration business, point demand already have supply. On the back end, make sure that Airbnb\u2019s are meeting your expectations. And in the rare event that they don\u2019t, we make it right, then these are going to continue to unlock significantly greater growth for us in the year ahead.\nDave Stephenson: Just to double quick on the strong \u2013 the second home impact question. If you go back and think about the 4 million hosts that we have a very different business than many others. So 90% of those hosts are individual hosts. They are the people that own a first \u2013 a primary home or maybe a secondary home and a big strength of our business, we saw this in COVID is that people even during an economic kind of shock period, they don\u2019t get rid of their primary home. They don\u2019t get necessarily getting rid of their secondary home, which is very different than professional hosts that maybe are doing an arbitrage of exact cost of ownership and return on the investment they can get on that specific property versus other alternatives. And so I think that this helps buffer any of those kind of impacts on our businesses, that individual host community.\nDoug Anmuth: Thank you.\nOperator: We will go next to Justin Post at Bank of America.\nJustin Post: Great, thanks. One quick one. When you say ADRs could face some pressure. Is that quarter-over-quarter or year-over-year in Q4? And then much bigger picture, solid bookings for 31% growth. Guidance probably implies well over 20 in Q4. How do we think about the backlog for \u201823 on revenues or associate that with potential revenue growth next year? Thank you.\nBrian Chesky: Alright, Dave, I think you can take this one.\nDave Stephenson: Sure. On the year-over-year for Q4 \u2013 the Q4 pressure ADR is year-over-year. In terms of the backlog for \u201823, it\u2019s a little early to tell, but really, what we\u2019re seeing is continued strong demand for travel overall. And like I said, when you look back to historic levels of growth back to 2019, we\u2019re seeing stable to increasing demand. We have strong bookings on the books for Q4, but then there will be fewer on the books yet for it kind of tails off into 2023. So it\u2019s a little early to say. But we\u2019re seeing no hints of a decline in people\u2019s demand and willingness to travel. It\u2019s just a little early to extrapolate much further.\nJustin Post: Great, thank you.\nOperator: We will move next to Mario Lu at Barclays.\nMario Lu: Thanks for taking the questions. First one is for Brian. You mentioned earlier this one that redesigning pricing and better transparency is a top priority for you. How much of an uplift could this be to conversion potentially? And what changes should we expect to see?\nBrian Chesky: Yes. Mario, yes. Just to give a little more context to those listening about pricing. Right now, we have pricing that is primarily displayed on a nightly rate. Post, you can then choose to add a cleaning fee and then Airbnb ad service fees. And one of the things that we\u2019ve been hearing from guests, and we heard it loud and clear, is that people would like a little more transparency about what they are actually paying when they first get to Airbnb. And so we are working on redesigning how pricing works on Airbnb, so people better understand the total price they are going to pay the moment they arrive at Airbnb, and it\u2019s not a surprise for them. So I think the north star for us on this matter is transparency. I think the benefit of this is going to be \u2013 we also want to make it easier for a host to understand what they are charging. And sometimes to tell us that they are not aware of what guests are paying because as you know, we add a guest service fee on top of the price that the host charge and occasionally hosts that they are charging more than they intended to. And so we are updating some of the tools to make it easier for hosts to understand what they are charging, and this will allow them to be more competitive. In addition to that, we\u2019re going to be updating our search ranking algorithm. We\u2019ve been making some refinements to prioritize home that offer a better value. And of course, when a guest checks out, they leave a 5-star rating. One of the questions we ask is on a scale of 1 to 5, how good of a value was this, and home to offer a great value are going to be prioritized higher in search results. And in addition to that, we\u2019re going to continue to develop new discounting tools, discounting tools like seasonal discounts, weekly discounts, peak season discounts and really tools to make host more competitive. If we do all this, I do believe the prices will get even more competitive. And one of the things we know is obviously as the prices get more competitive, conversion rate goes up and as conversion rate goes up, bookings go up. And just the final thing to say is we will have some updates on this soon. I\u2019ll be in making some announcements soon.\nMario Lu: Great, thanks, Brian. And just one on the operational take rate. I believe it\u2019s still above 14% and has not changed much over the past few years. So firstly, one, is that correct? And if so, what are your thoughts on adjusting up or down in the future to drive demand?\nBrian Chesky: Yes, it\u2019s a great question, Mario. I\u2019ll start and Dave, you can feel free to jump in. We do not have an intention to increase take rate. I mean this is a company that, obviously, in the last quarter did more than $1 billion in net income, nearly $1 billion of free cash flow. So I think there is a lot of levers to increase monetization on Airbnb, but I don\u2019t think we have to increase take rate to do that. In other words, there is opportunities like to allow additional services to host that we could charge for, and we think they pay for that we can do. So there is a lot of ways to increase the take rate on Airbnb. There are going to be some areas where we can probably optimize and improve take rates and potentially lower a little bit like on long-term space. If you\u2019re booking a place for 2, 3, 4 months, we think conversion rate might go up if we were to lower the take rate a little bit. But I don\u2019t think this would cut into our current business. I think that might actually keep more bookings on the platform. So we are going to continue to look at some optimization, but we think that we provide a great value. And I think if we make some of these pricing and discount changes in the coming future, I think the value on Airbnb will get even better. We\u2019re going to remain disciplined on our expenses. And there is a lot of monetization opportunities going forward. But our general view is if we\u2019re going to charge more, we should provide more. That\u2019s our North Star.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We will go next to Bernie McTernan at Needham & Company.\nBernie McTernan: Great. Thank you for taking question. I realize that you guys are saying you\u2019re not seeing any negative impact yet from the macro on the consumer. But as you think about different scenarios playing out and the potential impact of a recessionary environment, is there any cohort or demographic data that you see from your consumers that makes you think Airbnb could be more resilient than broader travel?\nBrian Chesky: I mean I could answer the high level and Dave, you can go in. I mean, Bernie, it\u2019s a very great question. One of the things we noticed during the pandemic \u2013 one of the lessons of the pandemic is I think Airbnb is the most adaptable business model in all of travel. And the reason why is we\u2019re not just the European business, we\u2019re not just a North American business. We are a truly global business. We\u2019re in 100,000 cities all over the world. We\u2019re not just a vacation rental business. We\u2019re also an urban business, also a cross-border business. We\u2019re not just a family business. We\u2019re also popular with millennials, Gen Z and retiree at nearly every type of price point. So I think that however travel demand changes, we will be able to adapt. And that\u2019s one of the great things about our model. It\u2019s a global network, guests become hosts. Most hosts are regular people that tell their friends about Airbnb, which is why when a market occupancy increases, it tends in itself create more supply. So these are some of the reasons why we feel very, very excited about our ability to continue to adapt given this challenging macroeconomic environment. Dave, I don\u2019t know if you want to add anything to it?\nDave Stephenson: Yes, I\u2019ll just double click. I mean, it\u2019s just a great value that we provide, right, that can people can pick anything from budget to luxe. And if a person has a certain kind of budget constraint, they can choose to maybe get a slightly smaller place or place with fewer amenities maybe they are well further out, like they can adjust the type of home they want based on their budget. And I think Airbnb has such a diversity of offerings that, that enables them to do it uniquely with us, which is very different than the flexibility they might have in hotels.\nOperator: We will move next to James Lee at Mizuho.\nJames Lee: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. And when we spoke with hoteliers in general, I think they are planning to keep the ADRs high and with reduced staffing levels. So just curious what you\u2019re thinking, does that present an opportunity for you to price your product more dynamically to demand and gain share? And also considering \u2013 are you also considering a price structure change charging guest fees given the tighter consumer budget? Thanks.\nBrian Chesky: Yes, James, yes, I think that as we give more tools to host to be able to dynamically price, they can be more competitive. And as they are more competitive, then we will continue to gain more share. So anything that allows greater value allows for more share. We don\u2019t \u2013 we\u2019re not \u2013 other than changing how pricing will be displayed to make it more transparent, intuitive and to continue to offer better value, we\u2019re not actually looking at a fundamental change to our pricing structure.\nOperator: We will move next to Richard Clarke at Bernstein.\nRichard Clarke: Alright. Thanks for taking my question. Just wondering, based on commentary, you\u2019re seeing urban coming back. How normal are we in that mix at the moment? And can you possibly quantify what the ADR headwind might be as urban continues to come back? And then maybe just the same question regionally, you\u2019re more skewed to the North American market than you were pre-COVID. Is that because those use cases are a bigger factor in North America or do you expect further changes in the geographical mix over time as well?\nBrian Chesky: Yes, Dave, you want to take this one?\nDave Stephenson: Sure. In terms of like urban coming back, it just continues to be a higher and higher percentage of our overall mix. It\u2019s not quite back to where it was in 2019, and it may never quite be because we see such great strength in our non-urban but urban is strengthening each quarter. And so that\u2019s the trend that we\u2019re seeing on the urban side. And I think it\u2019s actually similar on the cross-border international side. We\u2019re not back to where we were in kind of 2019 level. Gross nights were like 48% were cross-border back in 2019. And what we\u2019ve just seen is a cross-border continues to be a greater, greater percentage every quarter, but we\u2019re not quite back to where we were in 2019.\nOperator: We will move next to Mark Mahaney at Evercore ISI.\nMark Mahaney: Okay, thanks. Let\u2019s see. David, could I ask you just adjust the over-earning question that the free cash flow margins are truly very impressive. Just you really see them you\u2019ve been at 40% plus or roughly for the last three quarters on a trailing 12-month basis. What would cause those margins to go materially higher or lower from here? Or is there a reason to think that they are roughly sustainable? And then can I just ask about Categories? I know somebody asked about this earlier. But Brian, these features can sometimes take quite a long time to kind of get broadly used and the doubt that they can have a major impact. And I think this is one of those that could, how long do you think it\u2019s going to take for Categories to be kind of widely adopted used and really start impacting and helping people better match up that supply \u2013 all the supply you have with the demand that\u2019s out there? Thanks.\nBrian Chesky: Alright. So we have two questions. I think, Dave, you can take the first one, and then I\u2019ll take Categories.\nDave Stephenson: Excellent. So yes, the free cash flow, I\u2019m really proud of our delivery of the free cash flow and the free cash flow margin. So thanks for calling it out. I mean we\u2019ve just made substantial improvement in the overall profitability of our business, right? We\u2019ve radically adjusted our marketing expenditures to be substantially lower. We\u2019ve made metronomic improvement in our variable costs. We\u2019re seeing great leverage in our fixed costs. We\u2019re being incredibly disciplined in our fixed cost growth, and that will continue going forward. And so all of those will be tailwinds to being able to maintain or even increase our free cash flow margins over time. As average daily rates could moderate next year, that does put a little bit of a headwind towards our margins. But I think the improvements in our variable costs and the fixed cost leverage should enable us to maintain or even increase free cash flow margins over the longer-term. What we will continue to have greater expansion in free cash flow margin to be some of the things that Brian talked about a little bit ago, it would be kind of incremental services or activities that we add for guests or host over time. And there is no immediate announcements of major changes that you should anticipate in \u201823, but know that, that is a focus for us and over a more extended period will drive incremental revenue for us and incremental margin.\nBrian Chesky: Yes. And to answer your other question about the kind of timing for wide adoption of Airbnb Categories, it\u2019s a great question. I think just to kind of zoom out, customers of travel have been, as you know, trained over the last 25 years to search a certain way. And that way is to go to a website, there is a search box, you type in where you want to go and you search. And then what you get is a list of results. You refine the results, you compare sometimes the different websites, different apps and then you make a booking. And I think this is going to be a year transition to retrain kind of customers about how they can search for travel on Airbnb. But I think we\u2019re going to start to see some really great momentum next year. Again, we are already seeing people discover home they never knew existed. We are seeing a lot more people engage with categories. The homes and categories have been viewed more than 300 million times, we are going to continue to be making improvements to this every single year. We have some upgrades coming out in two weeks in November. And of course, you are going to see some upgrades beyond that as well. So, I think this is a really great opportunity for us. And again, because we are a little more concentrated in vacation travel, the business travel, and because people are increasingly more flexible when they travel, we think they are going to be much more open to ideas from Airbnb. And part of this is idea of Airbnb becoming more at the top of the funnel. The way the travel funnel used to be, if you go to one website to figure out where to travel, these are typically travel content sites. Then you go to the next site, typically to book your flight, and then the third thing you do is get your hotel or get your housing. So, with Airbnb was kind of step three. And we like Airbnb to go from kind of step three to step one. This is going to take some retraining for everything to go from step three to step one, but I think there is definitely a line of sight to getting there.\nOperator: We will go next to Stephen Ju at Credit Suisse.\nStephen Ju: Okay. Thank you. Hi Brian.\nBrian Chesky: Hey.\nStephen Ju: So, you guys took off you \u2013 you guys took out the China supply, but maintained your outbound business. It\u2019s probably a little bit too early to tell and there probably isn\u2019t a lot of outbound happening as of yet. But is there anything we should worry about from a customer acquisition funnel or retention standpoint because the Airbnb use case for, I guess the Chinese traveler is going to get reduced to, I guess international only versus what was previously domestic plus international? Thanks.\nBrian Chesky: Yes. Stephen, I mean the crown jewel of our China business was always and we thought always was going to be the China outbound business. And the reason why is the take rate was higher for the outbound business than it was for the domestic business. The inventory is more unique. There is less competition and the average daily rate is a lot higher. So, the outbound business was always the price part of our business. And that\u2019s what we are focused on. Now, as you know, not a lot of people are leaving the country right now, but we want to be prepared for when they do. And they eventually will, of course. And so the two things we are doing to prepare is, number one, we are going to be continuing to invest in our brand in China. And number two, if people are traveling and they are leaving China, they are going to other countries, and we would call these the core to countries. And the primary place, they are first probably going to go with intra-region. So, they are presumably going to be going to Southeast Asia, Korea, Japan. Eventually, they will go a little further to Europe and then they will presumably come back to the United States, especially maybe the kind of some of the coastal cities. And this is kind of how I think travel may recover. And so what we need to do is make sure we have enough supply in these corridors and continue to invest in our brand in China. And I think by only having an outbound business, we can actually focus all of our investments just on that, and it actually makes a lot more cost effective, a lot more efficient. And one thing I have learned is more focused we are, the more likely we are to achieve our results. So, that\u2019s what we are feeling. We are actually feeling really confident about the prospects for China. It\u2019s just going to be a longer like payoff than because of the fact that not a lot of people are leaving the country and traveling right now.\nOperator: We will go next to Eric Sheridan at Goldman Sachs.\nEric Sheridan: Thanks for taking the question. Maybe a two-parter, if I can on investment strategy. Obviously, we have a lot of technology companies that are talking about slowing hiring, possibly pruning talent out of their organizations. How do you think that positions you to possibly upgrade talent within the organization, Brian? And how are you thinking about hiring goals over the next sort 12 months to 18 months? And then the second part of the question is, obviously, a slow in the economy would not be like the existential crisis that travel belt in spring of 2020. But what\u2019s your broader philosophy of investing through a soft patch in the economy or more closely aligning revenue growth with expense growth if you did see a soft patch over a couple of quarters? Thanks so much.\nBrian Chesky: Yes. Hey Eric, good to talk to you. Yes, let me just recap how we think about expense management and investments. Before the pandemic, we were essentially a nearly breakeven business doing like a little under $250 million in loss from an EBITDA perspective. And of course, in the pandemic hit, we lost 80% of our business, and we completely changed our cost structure. And out of that crisis, we made a decision. And the decision we made is we weren\u2019t going to wait for another crisis, another weakened economy or a recession to change how we invest or we run the company that we were going to be lean regardless of the economy. In other words, we were going to go from the Navy to the Navy seal, a small, lean, elite group. And so we are a small team, we are functionally organized. We are only slightly more than 6,000 people in the beginning of this year. Before obviously, the economy took a turn for the worst, we still only had a plan to hire 7% to 8% more employees. In other words, we had a plan to be really profitable and we were planning for a storm. And so we have not had a change anything about our hiring plans. We don\u2019t intend to change anything about our hiring plans in the next 12 months to 18 months regardless of the economy because one of the lessons we have learned is a smaller we are, the more nimble we are, the faster we can move. And not only can we be more profitable, we can actually grow faster. And we have been actually more productive than we ever were in our history. We have made more than 150 upgrades in innovation across the core service. So, we are still really aggressive about trying to attract the best of our generation to this company, but that doesn\u2019t mean hiring a lot of people. We are really embracing being a lean organization, which is partly our functional structure. We are not a business organization where you would have four marketing departments. We have one functional organization, and so that allows us to be quite a bit leaner. And I guess that goes to your other question, which is slowness in the economy. Well, regardless of what happens to the economy, our model is highly adaptable. We have a very low expense base. And we are pretty efficient with marketing. We spend a lot less on marketing than our competitors and the vast majority of our traffic is direct. So, whatever happens to the economy, I think we are in a pretty good position where we won\u2019t have to change the way we run the company. But I think we have proven if we ever have to, of course, we will. But I don\u2019t expect for us to have to make a lot of changes because of how much cash we are generating, because of how lean we already are.\nDave Stephenson: And if I double-click on one area is that we announced our Live and Work Anywhere policy this year, and I think that has enabled us to hire the best people in the world regardless of where they live. And so to Brian\u2019s point about hiring fewer, more senior, and more experts in areas, this has clearly been able to make sure that we are getting the best talent in the world.\nBrian Chesky: Yes. And maybe the last thing I will just say is I think that we learned a lot of lessons probably a year or 2 years earlier than a lot of other tech companies because we were hit so hard so early. But I think the adversity, the challenge we had just made us a much more focused, a much better company. And one of the commitments we made is we are never going to forget the lessons from the pandemic. We are never going to lose our discipline. Because the more disciplined we are, the more focused we are, not only to become more profitable, but we actually innovate faster. And so those principles are here to stay.\nOperator: We will move next to Ron Josey at Citi.\nRon Josey: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe a bigger picture question first, Brian, and then Dave, one for you on just guidance. Just I think, Brian, you were talking maybe intra-quarter about AirCover being a major franchise going forward. Clearly, we will hear more about this in the winter release. But just talk to us about how AirCover might expand longer term. We clearly see it for guests, for host. We know we will have more updates here in the next week or two weeks. But just bigger picture, how you see it as a franchise. And then, Dave, just on guidance, I think in the letter, we mentioned longer lead time for bookings, stronger backlog for 4Q. Just trying to understand how that might compare to where we were maybe in prior periods at the same time. Thank you.\nBrian Chesky: Alright. I will take obviously the first one, Ron. Thanks. So yes, questions around kind of the longer-term strategy around AirCover. And maybe the way to explain AirCover, let\u2019s just take as an analogy, let\u2019s take Amazon. So, my recollection of Amazon, this will go back maybe 20 years, because 20 years ago, Amazon even back then, their core retail business was an amazing product. They had the most amount of selection on the Internet, and they have the lowest prices. But the problem with Amazon is they had an Achilles\u2019 heel. And the Achilles\u2019 heel was they were competing with walking in a store and taking something out at that moment. And so one of the things they created was Amazon Prime, which was obviously addressing the core Achilles\u2019 heel, which was shipping. I think every business has to understand what its potential weakness is. I think the great thing about Airbnb\u2019s model is we similarly have probably the widest selection of accommodations and everything we have is truly one of a kind at a great value. But our challenge is unlike a hotel, we don\u2019t control the inventory and it cannot structurally always be as consistent. We can\u2019t expect every property. So, AirCover similar for consistency addresses something similar to what Prime did for Amazon with shipping, which is to say, what if we could take this off the table, this question of consistency. And on the host side, the protections have led to a huge increase in NPS. Our NPS for AirCover for a host is over 60. And this is after something happened to your home. So clearly, this was a huge hit. And it was so popular that we decided to bring it to guests. And I think where this can go is over the coming years, we can offer increasingly more protection, more coverage for more different use cases. And I think the North Star for AirCover is if a listing was across \u2013 most of our inventory is only in Airbnb. But let\u2019s say a home was on two different websites, Airbnb and another website, we want AirCover to be so compelling that just by having AirCover alone, it would be reason to go direct and book on Airbnb and not book anywhere else. And we are going to continue to make improvements every single year, and I want AirCover to be the gold standard for customer service for our category. And that\u2019s what we are really focused on. And then down the road, there may be opportunities to offer like a paid version of this or some other type of membership program, but that would be down the road, but it\u2019s a very popular customer request.\nOperator: We will go next to Deepak \u2013 I apologize.\nDave Stephenson: And then in terms of \u2013 to answer the question on guidance, too. On the guidance, articulation of the longer lead times for bookings and just the Q4 bookings that we have already on the books for the rest of this quarter is just to indicate that we have stable to accelerating demand for growth, right. And demand from our guests around the world. It\u2019s that we are not seeing a softening in that demand especially when you look back to historic levels of 2019, that any of the deceleration in revenue growth between Q3 and Q4 is largely due to the uniqueness of the 2021 timing of growth between Delta and Omicron. So, I just think it just shows the stability of people wanting to get out their homes, wanting to travel, regardless of the macroeconomic uncertainties.\nOperator: We will move now to Deepak Mathivanan at Wolfe Research.\nDeepak Mathivanan: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Just a couple of quick ones. So first, there has been a lot of press recently about how occupancies on the platform are down for certain house hosts. Is it just anecdotal or seasonal or whether there is anything more to it? I mean your 4Q guidance is pretty strong, but just trying to understand how much of this is just kind of noise out there. And then second question, maybe for Brian. Long-term stays is stabilizing near 20% of the mix on the platform, even as sort of your room nights is growing pretty nicely, you have talked about sort of like the flexibility and lifestyle for many people keeping this \u2013 or helping this growth. But curious whether there is also like a bigger macro drivers like maybe rental markets being very difficult right now that\u2019s helping this trend. Just kind of trying to understand how much you are reaching already into the addressable markets beyond travel currently.\nBrian Chesky: Yes. I can \u2013 I will take both, and then Dave can feel free to dive in, especially on the bookings. I mean I think our \u2013 just to answer your question on whether bookings were down for hosts. I mean at the macro level, at the high level, they are not down. And I mean I think the Q3 results speak for themselves. There are anecdotal descriptions of some host bookings are down, some host bookings are up. And this \u2013 there is many possible explanations for this. It\u2019s just that travel is continuing to change. One of the other things though is that our search rank algorithm is prioritizing all-in pricing and host with the best value. So, it\u2019s possible that might be one possible explanation. But again, it\u2019s primarily what we have seen is anecdotal. And it really depends \u2013 you really have to take it on a case-by-case basis. But overall, obviously, bookings are up. In fact, it\u2019s a record quarter. Now, with regard to long-term stays beyond travel, I mean feedback, I would just say that we have only scratched the surface. A fifth of our nights book are for stays longer than a month. And this is before making some really big fundamental improvement to this product in this category. And I think in the coming years, flexibility is here to stay. I think more people are going to work remotely in a hybrid way 5 years from now than they do today. I think increasingly, fewer people are going to have 1-year leases, not to say no one will, but more and more people are going to value the flexibility and want to live in different places. And we think there is a real opportunity. And one of the things we are going to also see over the coming years isn\u2019t just that people are going to live in different parts of the United States, but people are going to choose to live for short periods of time abroad in different countries. So, we think we are going to start to see more long-term cross-border business, too. So, there is a lot of opportunities here. And we are going to be making some upgrades to our long-term stay business to tap into this large market. I mean the largest expense that most people have in their life is their housing, it\u2019s their housing costs. And we have built many of the tools and features that you would need to provide for a longer term stay offering already. But we are going to continue to make improvements. And as we do, I think we will continue to take more and more of that market.\nOperator: Next, we will move to Lee Horowitz at Deutsche Bank.\nLee Horowitz: Great. Thanks. So, building on the comments earlier about expense growth. Given that your advertising strategy has moved away from, say, purely demand linked performance advertising and more towards longer-dated ROI investments and brand advertising. How do you think about actively flexing down your advertising spend in a perhaps a tougher macro environment versus investing into that environment to continue to teach the customers \u2013 retrain the customers about your ever-expanding product set?\nBrian Chesky: Dave, do you want to start with this?\nDave Stephenson: Sure. I mean if you look at our actual advertising strategy and the amount of money we are spending on it, it\u2019s going to be relatively flat from \u201822 over \u201821, and you should anticipate similar marketing as a percentage of revenue in \u201823. And so we can certainly flex it in line with revenue. We will be kind of mindful of that. But what we have already kind of hit this new kind of lower overall rate. And what we have actually seen is, to the extent that we are keeping it flat even as we grow, it\u2019s because we are actually seeing such success that we are wanting to be able to invest in other countries. Certainly, we can moderate that over time, but we are already so low that I wouldn\u2019t anticipate us dropping it dramatically in face of substantial headwinds over growth. But we can flex it with the revenue within a reasonably a few hundred basis points here and there.\nBrian Chesky: And I will just say \u2013 just to jump in. I mean we don\u2019t really think of marketing as a way to buy customers because, obviously, as we have mentioned, more than 90% of our traffic is direct or organic. And so the main thing is we take a full funnel approach to marketing. And actually the top of the funnel is PR and communication. And we think that\u2019s one of the biggest drivers of our traffic is PR. And then brand marketing is actually important. And actually, we think a bit more like product marketing. We want to educate people about our new features. So, right now, we are advertising and educating people about Airbnb Categories and AirCover. And then we think that performance marketing is more of a way the laser in to balance supply and demand rather than a way purchased a large amount of customers. And that\u2019s essentially the way we think about marketing. And this allows for a very efficient, very dynamic approach to marketing that should get more efficient every single year.\nOperator: And we will take our final question from Brad Erickson at RBC Capital Markets.\nBrad Erickson: Hey. Thanks. Few follow-ups. First, nights came up just a bit light of where we all had it forecasted. So, obviously, that\u2019s on us. But I guess in cases where you are maybe seeing a little bit of nights booked softness, are you seeing those hosts making moves on price, or are your pricing tools sending any message to those hosts about making moves? Just curious if you look to affect some elasticity in the event of any pockets of softness. And then second, Dave, I know you spoke to this just a minute ago on the backlog, but asked in a different way. Are you basically saying that you are seeing booking windows expand more than prior years here as we start out Q4? Thanks.\nBrian Chesky: Yes. Brad, I will take the first question. I think Dave can take the second. Yes, I mean what we do see is that many hosts do bring their prices up or down as demand goes up or down. That being said, I think there is opportunities for us to have more dynamic tools and give more visibility that would make prices even more competitive. To answer your question, they do, many hosts do adjust their prices, but I think hosts probably adjust their prices less frequently than hotels. And so in periods of time where prices are generally coming down in the industry, we might be a little bit slower. But as we build more tools to provide more dynamic changes, we will be \u2013 continue to be more competitive. And I will let Dave take next question.\nDave Stephenson: Yes. Well, a couple of things. One thing is we are not focused on optimizing just night side. I think nights is an important measure, and it\u2019s an important driver of kind of overall demand. But we could also drive a lot of nights and looking and try to just drive them towards lower rate nights. Like we are trying to drive a balance of making sure that we have nights growth and revenue growth. And revenue growth obviously pays the bills. And so we are seeing strong growth in the business. I am very happy with our Q3 results. And on our full guide like you said, I think we are seeing stable to increasing demand, and we are just really impressed with the resiliency of guests and their willingness to travel and interest in traveling Airbnb. And I guess it goes back to the backlog, too, is that the reason why we kind of highlight is just that people are having confidence in travel. So, what we are seeing is that, yes, the booking windows are up year-over-year. There are a little bit \u2013 there is some seasonality in that. So, they are actually booking windows a little bit down from Q3. And so as \u2013 the lead times are just up from historical levels because the people are confident in being able to travel, I think that\u2019s the important thing you should take away.\nOperator: And that concludes the question-and-answer session. At this time, I will turn the conference back over to Brian for any concluding remarks.\nEnd of Q&A:\nBrian Chesky: Alright. Well, first of all, thank you all for joining today. I just want to recap and just say we are incredibly proud of our results. And I believe we are incredibly well positioned for the future ahead. I hope you all join us in two weeks for 2022 winter release. You will be able to watch it right from our homepage on Wednesday, this is November 16th, 8 a.m. Eastern.

Earlier today, we issued a shareholder letter with our financial results and commentary for our second quarter of 2022. These items were posted on the Investor Relations section of Airbnb's website. During the call, we'll make brief opening remarks and then spend the remainder of time on Q&A.  Before I turn it over to Brian, I would like to remind everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements on this call that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described under forward-looking statements in our shareholder letter and in our most recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained on this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. You should be aware that these statements should be considered estimates only and are not a guarantee of future performance.  Also, during this call, we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures. We provided reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in the shareholder letter posted to our Investor Relations website. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be substitute for our GAAP results.  And with that, I will pass the call to Brian.\nBrian Chesky: All right. Thank you, Ellie, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining.  Our Q2 results demonstrate that Airbnb has achieved growth and profitability at scale. From a growth perspective, we exceeded 103 million Nights and Experiences Booked. Now this was our largest quarterly number ever. Revenue was $2.1 billion, up 58% from last year or 64%, excluding foreign exchange. Gross booking value was $17 billion, up 27% from last year or 34% if you exclude foreign exchange. Now both revenue and GBV were 73% higher than Q2 2019, significantly outperforming the travel industry.  Now from a profitability perspective, we had our most profitable Q2 ever. Net income of $379 million was a nearly $700 million improvement from Q2 2019. Adjusted EBITDA was $711 million. Now this represents a 34% adjusted EBITDA margin, which is significantly up from the 16% margin in Q2 2021, a negative 4% in Q2 2019. Finally, we generated $795 million of free cash flow. Now this is a $1.1 billion improvement from the nearly $300 million cash burn 2 years ago at the depth of the pandemic. Over the last 12 months, Airbnb generated $3 billion in free cash flow, nearly $3 billion, and ended the quarter with nearly $10 billion in cash.  So what explains this transformation in our business? Well, first, our business model is adaptable. We have nearly every type of space in nearly every location so however travel changes, we can adapt. And regardless of the economic environment, our guests come to Airbnb because they can find great value and our host can earn extra income.  Second, we've relentlessly innovated while also staying focused and disciplined. When the pandemic began in 2020, we made some incredibly difficult decisions. We significantly reduced spending, making us a leaner and more focused company. And we've kept this discipline ever since, allowing us to keep the hiring and investment plans made in the beginning of the year. And Airbnb is well positioned for whatever lies ahead. In fact, we're so confident in our long-term growth and profitability that today, we're announcing a $2 billion share repurchase program. And this is coming only 1.5 years after our IPO.  Now returning to our Q2 results. Our strong financial performance was driven by a number of positive business trends. First, guest demand in Airbnb is as high as ever. In Q2, we surpassed 103 million Nights and Experiences Booked, marking our highest quarterly number ever. Now despite broader macroeconomic concerns, we still saw a 25% increase in Nights and Experiences Booked compared to the quarter of 2021.  Now early in Q2, strong guest demand exceeded our expectations. This is because guests in Europe and North America booked earlier than they have historically. Now given this earlier booking, growth rates compared to last year decelerated in May and June. And since the end of Q2, what we've seen is growth in nights booked reaccelerate from June to July as we enter peak travel season.  Second, guests continue to return to cities and cross borders. In previous quarters, we've talked about how we saw significant growth driven by surges in domestic travel as well as travel to rural destinations. Now these trends continue. But we're also seeing guests returning to cities and crossing borders above pre-pandemic levels.  Third, guests continue to stay longer in Airbnb. They're not just traveling Airbnb, they're now living on Airbnb. We saw long-term stays of 28 days or more remain our fastest-growing category by trip nights compared to 2019. The long-term stays has increased nearly 25% from a year ago. And actually, long-term stays have increased almost 90% since Q2 2019.  Fourth, guest demand is driving growth on our host community. We continue to see the strongest supply increases in areas of greatest demand, with nonurban active listings up 50% compared to Q2 2019. But as demand is returning to cities, we're also seeing an increase in total urban supply. And we believe the upgrades we introduced last year, including our new host onboarding flow and AirCover are supporting this growth, but we're not stopping there. So you're going to see some exciting new product features to recruit the next generation of host later this year.  Finally, I'd like to share a few highlights from the 2022 summer release. In May, we introduced Airbnb Categories. Since launch, listings in the Airbnb Categories have been viewed more than 180 million times. Through Categories, we are distributing guest discovery across more destinations and dates.  Now we also introduced AirCover for guests. Since launch, the Net Promoter Score for guests that had an issue with their stay has already improved. And the real insulin -- instance where our host cancels, AirCover has led to 10% more rebookings.  So to recap. We achieved significant milestones this quarter with our results. Nights and Experiences Booked were our highest ever. Revenue and adjusted EBITDA were records for Q2, and free cash flow was $795 million. In the last 12 months, we generated nearly $3 billion in free cash flow.  Now before I go to questions, I want to talk about an update on my co-founder, Joe Gebbia. Last month, Joe announced that he'll be stepping back from this full-time operating role. Joe will continue to serve on the Board of Directors of both Airbnb and Airbnb.org. Airbnb is a founder-led company. So he's going to continue to take a role at Airbnb, and this will be as an adviser to me on future concepts and creative culture.  Since the beginning, Joe has always been focused on big ideas to help others. These are uncompromising True North. So it will be fun to be able to spend more time with them on dreaming up new ideas, just like the early days. And as I reflect back on the last 14 years together, I just can't believe how lucky Joe, Nate and I have been. If anything, I've just gone a few degrees in a different direction, I wouldn't be doing this call with you right now. That's how fragile ideas are. And it's what gives me gratitude to know Joe and Nate. And what I'm most thankful for is that we're still together, still meeting every Sunday 14 years after we started. We built a dream together, and now, after all these years, we still continue to dream. So thank you, Joe.  And with that, Dave and I look forward to answer your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Lloyd Walmsley with UBS.\nLloyd Walmsley: Two questions, if I can. First, just it looks like room Nights and Experiences Booked grew a little bit sequentially less in 2Q this year than it did in '19. And similarly, the guidance looks like it's calling for a little bit slower sequential growth. Just wondering if there's anything you'd call out that's behind that?  And then secondly, can you give us an update on what you're seeing around just how people are using the platform post some of the new search and discovery innovations this summer? Are you seeing demand move into a wider dispersion of areas or any changes in conversion rates? What are early learnings from some of those innovations this past summer?\nBrian Chesky: Thank you very much. Dave, why don't you take the first question about Q2, Q3 growth, and I can talk a little bit about how the launch from Airbnb Categories have affected how people use Airbnb?\nDavid Stephenson: Yes. So our Q2 gross nights before the cancellations, they came in actually above our internal expectations. We did see some elevated cancellations in the back of the quarter relative to our forecast. We believe that some of the elevated cancellation's related to flight cancellations around the world, but it was mostly in North America towards the end of Q2 '22. And we're just seeing strong overall nights kind of growth, the 25% year-over-year growth in nights and experiences, we feel very confident in. And the same -- having the same results for Q3, we also feel quite good about. We're just seeing strong demand for guest travel all around the world.\nBrian Chesky: And just to answer the second question, just to give a little bit of background, for decades, travel search has worked the same way. There's a box, a search box, and you are asked to enter a location. And the problem with that is that Airbnb is in 100,000 locations all over the world. And so people can't think to type in 100,000 destinations into a search box. And so people miss millions of unique Airbnbs they would have never known to search for. And the reason this is important, as you asked is because we think that category categories can allow us to point demand to where we have supply. This, I think, is one of the really big opportunities.  So as I said, since release, listings in every categories have been viewed over 180 million times. We've also seen that guests are now showing more flexibility with their dates and their destinations than before. So for example, a typical search, properties are 30 miles further apart than they would have been before. So we are seeing search radiuses increase. And additionally, we are seeing more people continue to use the flexible date feature. So we believe our theory is working. Airbnb categories allows us to highlight what makes us unique. It allows us to point demand where we have supply. And I also think it helps us be in the inspiration business where people to start to travel on Airbnb.\nOperator: Our next question is from Mario Lu with Barclays.\nMario Lu: So the first one is on new initiatives. So we look at the third quarter guidance, it seems like bookings is expected to contract by more than 10 points in 3Q versus 2019 versus the second quarter. So does that change the timing or focus on these other new initiatives such as experiences? Or are more resources now being focused back on the core business?\nBrian Chesky: No. I mean we have a very consistent strategy. And our strategy is, number one, we want to unlock the next generation of hosts. We have 4 million hosts on Airbnb, and I think that millions more can turn to hosting, especially during these economic times. So that, I think, is really priority #1.  As we add more hosts, we continue to grow. We want Airbnb to be the ultimate host to our guests and host. That's why we offered AirCover where we continue to provide better service all over the world and continue to up level. And guests aren't just traveling Airbnb, they're now living on Airbnb. And so we want to continue to offer more opportunities for them to travel and live on Airbnb.  So we are still focused on our core business. That is the priority for us. We are also continuing to invest in long-term stays and other initiatives and most importantly, providing an incredible service that people love. And I would also just say, again, we're feeling really, really solid and good about Q3. Dave, anything you want to add.\nDavid Stephenson: Yes. I'll just double click on Brian's comment. Yes, I mean, we do really feel good about stable bookings in Q3. I mean, in particular, given we have long lead times that we're seeing. We're seeing some pull forward for summer travel here in Q2 and just the broader economic conditions overall. We are -- if you look at our gross booking value growth versus 2019, Q1 was 73%; Q2, 73%. We're just seeing strong gross booking value growth relative to 2019. And to see further kind of quarter-over-quarter acceleration, we just need to see continued recovery in Europe and APAC, which remains significantly depressed.\nMario Lu: Great. And just a follow-up, speaking of APAC. You guys mentioned that the domestic business is trending down in China, which I believe you guys said was around 1% of your business. Is there any other color you can provide in terms of the P&L impact from shutting that down? And any color on how large the outbound bookings for China is?\nBrian Chesky: Dave?\nDavid Stephenson: Yes. I mean the China business has been a small part of business overall. I mean, it's had less than a 1% impact on our revenue. One of the things that has been important in us getting out of the domestic business in China is maintaining a focus on what we think is the most valuable and important part of China, which is the outbound business. So really, what we've done is we've shifted all of the resources that we're applying and splitting between both domestic and outbound travel. We focused all that on outbound, which we think is the greater prize and the most important part for the long term.  So until China has their COVID policy kind of in place and allowing people to kind of travel outbound from China, it will kind of remain to be depressed. But as that evolves and Chinese travelers travel again, we think that will be a nice unlock for our Asia Pacific business. It's not going to have a material impact on our P&L.\nOperator: Our next question is from Bernie McTernan with Needham & Company.\nBernard McTernan: Great. ADRs are hanging in there better than feared, I believe, still expecting them to be up year-over-year. Can you just talk to some of the puts and takes, demand-driven pricing versus mix shift?\nBrian Chesky: Dave?\nDavid Stephenson: Yes. If you kind of rewind to what we've seen with ADRs back at the beginning of the pandemic, all of the increase was driven by mix, right? This initial resurgence of the travel for North America, whole home, nonurban. And then over time, we've seen mix become less and less a part of the increase in the ADR.  Here in both Q1 and Q2, what we've seen is that ADRs were up 40% year over -- 3 years back to 2019. And about 2/3 of that increase has been price appreciation, and about 1/3 due to mix. And so we do anticipate that over time, as more people return to travel to urban, more cross border, ADRs may moderate. But yes, as you see, 2/3 of that has actually been price appreciation. So it's been stickier than we anticipated, maybe 6 months ago.\nBernard McTernan: Got it. And then the dip in May and June from the earlier booking windows and then reacceleration in July, is that reacceleration for near-term bookings in terms of late summer? Or is that kind of early bookings for the fall and winter period?\nDavid Stephenson: Well, it's a bit of both. I mean, really, we have on the books for Q4 of this year, we have more nights on the books in Q4 than relative to the same kind of period a year ago. It's very strong. We're seeing really strong demand in the back half of the year. So we're seeing a bit of both.\nOperator: Our next question is from Justin Patterson with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nJustin Patterson: Great. Two, if I can. Brian, when you look at host right now and just the friction to onboarding, what are you looking to really solve with this upcoming release? And then secondly, perhaps for both you and Dave, you've clearly shown a lot of margin progress, free cash flow progress over the next few years. How should we think about just the puts and takes between overall growth and showing more margin, more free cash flow generation ahead?\nBrian Chesky: And just to confirm, you're talking about with this upcoming release, right, this winter?\nJustin Patterson: Yes. Well, I mean it can be a little broader in there. Just where the friction point on onboarding is.\nBrian Chesky: Yes. So that's a great question. Let me -- why don't I answer the first question, and then, Dave, you can talk about margin improvement, and then I can potentially elaborate on that answer as well. We have -- as we said, we have 4 million hosts on Airbnb, but we think there are millions more people that could turn to hosting. I mean, honestly, hosting is one of the easiest ways to be able to make money with an asset that you already have. For most people, they don't need to have a start-up cost and the majority of people get a booking within the first week.  And so there are a number of things that we're going to be doing this fall -- this winter and beyond, but one of the most important things we want to do is continue to make it easier to host. And one of the high -- things I want to highlight that we launched last year was Ask a Super Host. Ask A Super Host pairs our very best super hosts with prospective hosts. And this is really cool because, basically, what it does is it allows our community to help train new community members, new hosts to come on the platform. That's made a big difference.  And we're going to continue to double down on that product. We're going to -- but we're looking at some other opportunities to continue to reduce friction. So you're going to see some really cool products to just continue to make it even easier to host. And so that's probably the primary thing that we're going to be focused on this fall. We're also looking at some additional protections for hosts, and just ways to really try to get everyday people with their primary homes that want to host occasionally to host on Airbnb.  A lot of people don't realize that the number -- the top professions for a host in the United States, for example, are school teachers, they're health care workers, they're students, these are top 3 kind of professions and locations in Airbnb. And so what we really think the big opportunity is to continue to attract regular people to become host. And we think one of the biggest sources of new hosts are prior guests on Airbnb, 36% of new hosts last quarter were prior guests.  So this is where we're going to be focused on. It's a really big opportunity for us. And I think, again, Airbnb was founded during a recession in 2008, financial crisis. People were worried about being able to pay their bills, pay for their homes and their income. And so they turned to hosting. And we think a lot of people may turn to hosting once again. So this is a big opportunity for us. Dave, if you want to talk about the margin improvement?\nDavid Stephenson: Yes. Thanks. We're really proud of the progress we made to reduce our fixed costs and make improvements in our variable costs. We've really exercised discipline on our spending here in 2022, and we're going to continue to do so. But while we're thrilled with this margin expansion, we're heavily in growth mode. We are not in profit maximization mode. We really want to balance profitability with growth.  We -- one of the things we're very proud in Q2 is that we are showing both growth and profitability at scale. But we'll continue to invest in growth. We're going to prioritize things. We'll grow the business over the long haul.\nOperator: Our next question is from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.\nDouglas Anmuth: Just hoping you can talk a little bit about just kind of macro environment, just what you're seeing in terms of consumer activity or types of trips being booked. And also just to get your view on long-term stays. I think you talked about 25% growth year-over-year, but just the trends there going forward.\nBrian Chesky: Dave?\nDavid Stephenson: Sure. Well, if you start the macro environment, again, we are very pleased with our results despite any kind of macroeconomic. We're seeing strong demand here in Q3. And as I said, the Q2 nights and experiences grew 25% year-over-year, we're seeing a similar growth for Q3, and our demand in Q4 reservations is really strong, as I mentioned kind of earlier.  What we've seen so far is North America and Europe have been our strengths. We're seeing -- but we are seeing an uptick in more cross-border and more urban. So those are historic strength areas for us, and we're starting to see those parts of the businesses come back. But ultimately, if you just kind of step back, you just see the resilience of our business overall, right, that because we have so much different kinds of supply in so many places around the world, we have any kind of place for anyone that wants to travel. And there's just so much pent-up demand for travel and just so much demand for travel in general, that people would like to spend money on the experience of travel and getting out of their home more than on things that we're just continuing to see that great strength in our business.  And then in terms of long-term stays, it continues to be the fastest-growing business by tripling. So if you look at nights of 28 days or longer, that part of the business is growing faster since 2019 than any other segment stays. And actually, if you kind of subsegment it, nearly 50% of our nights are 7 days or longer. And which I think, again, you start to stay any place 7 days or more, an Airbnb is the best way to kind of experience that stay. So long-term stay trend continues to be very solid, growing faster than any other part of the business.\nOperator: The next question is from Nick Jones with JMP Securities.\nNicholas Jones: Two. I guess, first, can you just kind of give us an update on the I'm Flexible option and how that's kind of playing out and what kind of experiences you're able to provide in those markets that maybe are less dense? And then a follow-up.\nBrian Chesky: Yes, yes. So Nick, I'm Flexible, essentially with the product that we launched last year, it really has 2 components. There's flexible dates that allows people to say, I'm flexible when to travel, and we can say, I'm really interested in traveling anywhere for a week and a week or a month anytime in the next year. And we also had I'm Flexible destinations.  We rebuilt I'm Flexible destination from the ground up, and that became Airbnb Categories. So that's the product that has been used or people have seen listings that have been featured in the Airbnb categories over 180 million times since May 11. This has definitely been like a huge boon for us. And what we're seeing is that people are, in fact, discovering homes they would have never otherwise seen in their books. We're seeing the search radius widen by, I think, it was 30 miles, what I said before.  The other thing we're seeing is that people are continuing to be more flexible about their dates. So more and more people are using the I'm Flexible dates feature as well.  And so we're really excited about this. I think this is a really big thing that we're going to be focusing on, and we're going to continue to be investing in this product because I think this is a bit of a paradigm shift for how people will travel. Not everyone is going to be flexible about how they travel. But for anyone that's not traveling for business or not visiting family, if you were doing leisure travel, almost by definition, you probably have some flexibility.  And as fewer and fewer people are going to be required to go into office 5 days a week, I think this option is going to be more and more important. And our business model works uniquely for this because we have a lot of unique inventory. So it has been used quite a lot, and hopefully, that answers your question.\nNicholas Jones: Yes. And then, I guess a follow-up is in some of the areas that are outside of urban areas, less dense, less, I guess, arguably activities, how are you thinking about adding more optionality to make these types of experience more engaging for the guests?\nBrian Chesky: Sorry, can you elaborate outside of urban areas. Or I'm trying...\nNicholas Jones: Like if you're in a rural area and there's less activities, arguably, because there's less population, how are you adding -- looking to add more experiences for those guests in those regions?\nBrian Chesky: Oh, I see. Yes. Well, it's a great question. So number one, Airbnb Categories and the new products we're doing are great ways to highlight really interesting home and communities you never know existed, right? We have like these incredible barns and farm stays and capsules and treehouses. And many of these are in towns you've probably never even heard of, most of them.  But there's another good question, if you go to Paris, you have the Eiffel Tower. But if you go to a rural area in upstate New York or in California or some other place, what do you do when you're there? And we do think Airbnb Experiences are great. Obviously, for like places that are not iconic tourism destination. So that's why we're continuing to invest in that product and people really love Airbnb Experiences. They actually have a higher 5-star rating even than home.  So I think this is a great opportunity for rural destinations, and we have a lot of really popular experiences. So like if you go on a farm, you can do a farm stay and then you can have interesting experiences on that farm. So that's just one example. We have really popular experiences, for example, in Tuscany. You can make pasta with a nearly 90-year-old grandmother who's been making pasta the same way for more than half a century. So these are experiences you would have never been able to find, and we're really excited about that.\nOperator: The next question is from James Lee with Mizuho.\nJames Lee: And maybe as we look into FY '23, obviously, we have a lot of economic uncertainties here. If the economy indeed slows down and consumers start to trade down, how do you think that impacts Airbnb's business?  And also on the other hand, if you look at expenses, the demand slowdown, is there anything in your cost structure you could optimize to offset any potential headwinds?\nBrian Chesky: Dave, do you want to take that?\nDavid Stephenson: Sure. I think we've highlighted this a bit on the call that you don't know what the economy is going to bring, but we do know that Airbnb is resilient to almost any kind of economic shock. As Brian mentioned, we're founded in a recession, and we've obviously thrived in the era of COVID despite COVID. And what we're just finding is that people can come to Airbnb because we have any kind of property, whether it's a small shared room or a private room to luxury stays, we have something for anyone depending on their travel needs.  And we likely saw on COVID, if they can't cross borders, they're going to stay domestically. They get in the car and they go down the road. If domestic -- if air travel gets too expensive, they -- again, they can stay domestically, and they can basically, within their budget, find the perfect place for them because we have such a diversity of types of offerings for them. So I think that is one of the things that just gives us this great resilience.  And then in terms of expenses, if the business slows down, I mean, again, we've already made the hard choices. In 2020, we substantially reduced our fixed costs. We eliminated a number of positions. We moved from being divisional to functional. So we are a leaner, tighter machine, and we will remain that way. We're going to continue to grow. We're growing headcount maybe high single-digit percentage rates, but that is going to be able to support us for the very long term, and we're going to remain very focused and disciplined in our investments. So I feel really good about the position that we're in with our investment model.\nOperator: The next question is from Brian Fitzgerald with Wells Fargo.\nBrian Fitzgerald: We wanted to ask about the recovery of supply that you continue to see, maybe particularly in urban areas. Are you seeing hosts who had come off the platform now coming back, wondering how you're making these hosts aware of the increased urban demand and helping to reactivate them? And any color there on that, maybe latent supply capacity, if you could, that'd be awesome.\nBrian Chesky: Dave, do you want to take this?\nDavid Stephenson: Yes. A couple of notes on the supply growth. We just continue to see strong supply growth. I think since 2019, our Nights and Experiences Booked, they grew 24%, and our active listings have grown 23%. And we have over 6 million active listings now even taking down the domestic listings in China. So as you mentioned on the urban side, the active listings -- well, I'll start with the nonurban. Nonurban increased 7% quarter-over-quarter and 16% from Q2 '21.  And then in North America, they've increased 23%. But then to your specific question, yes, as demand returns to cities, we're seeing a return to growth in the total urban supply. And exactly right, the people that have properties, they come back on to Airbnb and are ready to host again. I mean, if you kind of step back and think about it, because the vast majority of our hosts are individual hosts, and then therefore, the vast majority of their listings are either their primary home or maybe a secondary home, they don't get rid of those in a recessionary environment and other things.  I mean it's not like a professional host, which may be looking at the pure return on investment opportunity of the property at a particular point in time. And so with those individual houses, when the demand comes back, they come back on to Airbnb and the listings are there. So it's precisely what we're seeing. When the demand comes back, the supply is right there ready for them to stay.\nOperator: The next question is from Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI.\nMark Mahaney: Okay. I think I'll ask two questions. Just talk about the China outbound market and how you tap into that, how material that's been for you to date? And then on experiences, I know that's in that list of -- a long list of things that you've been working on in terms of product innovations. It seems like it was less -- it's been less of a priority, but is there anything that suggested it's rising a little bit in your list of priorities and that you want to lean into it more aggressively in '23?\nBrian Chesky: Yes. Dave, why don't you take China, I can expand on the answer and I'll take Experiences.\nDavid Stephenson: Yes. I mean we're very bullish on China over the longer term. I mean it's obviously been significantly impacted due to COVID. People are not traveling outbound. I mean that's actually right how we started the business, is seeing great outbound travel from China all around the world. And then -- and that is still the prize for us to kind of continue to focus on.  So right now, APAC is still significantly depressed. I mean if you look at our overall nights growth, as we said, it's 25% up from Q2 of 2019. But if you exclude APAC, it's actually up 35%. So you can see what kind of a drag that has. And I think the reacceleration -- further acceleration of the business from where we're at today will be benefited by having -- trying to outbound come back and resurrecting our APAC business.\nBrian Chesky: Yes. I would just add to that, that we have absolutely seen in every other geography in the world that there is pent-up demand. In North America, there was pent-up demand. In Europe, there was pent-up demand. We expect there will probably be a lot of pent-up demand for travel from China outbound and more broadly in APAC.  And so how we've been preparing? Well, number one way to prepare for the China outbound business is to make sure we have really great supply in the corridors where people in China are traveling to. This includes like Japan and Korea, Southeast Asia and beyond. The next thing is just making sure that once people are ready to travel, our product is continuing to be updated, and we have the marketing campaign ready to go. So it's a pretty simple strategy.  The great thing is we don't have to make a lot of changes. We think our product as it is, is going to be great once the China outbound rebounds, and we think it will. We expect -- everything suggests it will, just like every other market. So we're pretty excited about that. And I think that in the coming years, this will actually be a pretty important part of our APAC business.  Now with regards to experiences, yes, I mean, Mark, let me just give a little bit of context. 2018, 2019 experiences is going along pretty well, and we expected that 2020 was going to be a breakout year for experiences. And I was going to -- we were going to focus quite a lot of energy on it. And then, of course, the opposite happened. There was a pandemic. We had to pause the business, people were not comfortable gathering in person, let alone meeting strangers.  And so during the depths of the pandemic, we got focused back on our core business. We got back to basics. And I think that explains a lot of the business transformation we experienced, especially now we've generated nearly [indiscernible] of free cash flow. That being said, we remain incredibly bullish about the long-term potential of experiences. The average 5-star rating for Experiences, as I mentioned, is higher than the average 5-star ratings even for homes. And we just think people need to know more about this product. It needs to be continually integrated into the search flow, and we need to continue to market it.  So the answer to your question, yes, Experiences will become once again a rising priority, and we are making quite a few investments in the product to continue to highlight experiences. And I think it's going to be a big part of our story in 2023 and beyond over really the next 5 years. So I'm really excited about them.\nOperator: Our next question is from John Colantuoni with Jefferies.\nJohn Colantuoni: So last quarter, you mentioned an expectation for marketing as a percentage of revenue to remain relatively flat compared to 2021. Maybe -- is it possible for you to update us on whether or not that's still your expectation following marketing in the first half coming in a few hundred basis points below last year? And I have a follow-up.\nBrian Chesky: Dave?\nDavid Stephenson: Yes. The short answer is we anticipate marketing as a percentage of revenue in 2022 will be consistent with 2021. So a very modest increase in the back half of the year.\nJohn Colantuoni: Okay. Great. And second question on take rate. It looks like outlook for the third quarter implies a take rate that's better than what we were expecting and up a decent chunk versus the same quarter in 2019. Any chance you can give us some detail about the puts and takes driving that take rate?\nDavid Stephenson: Yes. The underlying kind of -- if you shifted take rate is unchanged. So any of the variation in take rate is just a timing difference between revenue stays versus timing of bookings.\nOperator: Our next question is from Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse.\nStephen Ju: So Brian, I think you yourself signed up to be a digital nomad and joined your employees who could now, I guess, work from anywhere. So is there anything you can share in terms of what you're seeing from the organization overall regarding pickups or declines in productivity or your ability to innovate?  And Dave, at the time of the IPO, I think you guys had disclosed that the different cohorts of guests were displaying pretty similar revenue retention as they age. But as we enter the pandemic, you probably had a pretty good influx of new users who signed up to experience Airbnb for the first time ever. So is there anything you can share in terms of the behavior of the 2020 and the '21 cohorts relative to what you have seen for the folks who are arguably the earlier adopters.\nBrian Chesky: Yes. So why don't I take the first question on really remote work. So in April, we announced that Airbnb employees can live and work anywhere. And why do we do this? Well, there are a couple of reasons. Number one, we had the most productive 2 years in our company history. And those 2 years were 2 years when we rebuilt the company from the ground up, fixed our cost base, accelerated growth. And all of this was done on Zoom. And so it's very clear to me that like the most productive we have ever been is on Zoom. And so I thought -- there was no question that we can maintain that productivity.  Additionally, I think a really good way to predict the future is to look at what young companies do, right? 20 years ago, young companies had open floor plans and they had a lot of perks on site, and that became the dominant way that people worked in offices around the world. If you look at a lot of young companies today, they have a lot of flexibility. They're embracing remote work. And so I think this is a really good leading indicator of what the office space -- office place -- office environment of the future will look like in the next 10 years.  Now that being said, we do think in-person interaction is really important, but I don't think that requires you to have to come to an office 3 days a week. So the guideline that we've given is we'd like to gather employees at least 1 week a quarter. So rather than kind of coming in every week, we want more meaningful, less frequent interactions and gatherings. And otherwise, we think Zoom is really, really efficient for productivity.  And the other thing I'll just say is I know a lot of CEOs are kind of nervous about productivity if their employees aren't in an office. But we have a pretty unique way we run the company. We do these 2 releases every year, and it's a really great mechanism for accountability. So you can see the productivity of everyone in the organization because all the work is kind of coming together twice a year to make these really big leaps in the organization. So it's actually, in a sense, kind of easier to track productivity when everything is really online. And so that's something that we're really embracing.\nDavid Stephenson: Great. And then relative to cohorts, what we're starting to see is we believe, to start with, that we have some of the highest guest retention rates in travel. We still -- we said it in our IPO, and we still believe that to be true. And our booking frequency remains quite strong. It's getting closer to 2019 levels. And as we manage -- look at the cohorts, really, what we're seeing in 2020 and 2021, the new guest cohorts, they've been actually very retentive, even maybe more so than kind of historical levels likely due to some self-selection.  New guests who joined in the years of pandemic are willing to kind of travel now are probably more inclined to kind of travel than others. And then in terms of rebooking rates of past guests, we've seen nice improving rates in those trends here in 2022, above kind of 2021 levels, but maybe still a bit below 2019, again, just given the nature of self-selection of who's willing to kind of travel at this time.\nOperator: The next question is from Kevin Kopelman with Cowen.\nKevin Kopelman: Can you give us a sense of what listings growth looks like ex the China shutdown? And then qualitatively, if you could talk about the key drivers and trends you're seeing there and listings.\nBrian Chesky: Dave, do you want to take that?\nDavid Stephenson: Yes. Yes. I mean in terms of the growth, what we've stated is that we're still well above 6 million active listings, even excluding the takedown of the China domestic. So -- and as we kind of mentioned in our results, we're seeing strong listings growth, specifically in the areas where we have the strongest kind of bookings. So...\nKevin Kopelman: Did you give the number of China listings?\nDavid Stephenson: We have not specifically mentioned the China listings, no.\nKevin Kopelman: Okay. And then just a quick follow-up on -- so on the Q2 guide, you talked about slowing later in the quarter, but you were still pretty much on your -- where you had guided for nights. Is it safe to assume for the third quarter, you're also assuming some slowdown in the remainder of that quarter?\nDavid Stephenson: Well, if anything, what we're seeing is an acceleration of the business here in July and actually kind of a very stable overall nights booked growth for the quarter on Nights and Experiences Booked. I mean, obviously, then for our revenue, it has a modest -- has a decel on a year-over-year basis, but actually will be up from kind of a year over 3 years.\nOperator: The next question is from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.\nBrian Nowak: I have two. The first one, just any update on the number of I'm Flexible queries or sort of how big that's gotten? I know it's a number that you all were disclosing for a couple of quarters. And then secondly, there remains to be an ongoing debate about how much of the shift toward Airbnb long-term accommodations was sort of COVID, and now you're going to have a mean reversion back to our hotels.  What are 2 or 3 of the KPIs that you look at that sort of give you confidence that your addressable market of users, of the hosts, everything has really expanded. Like what are you seeing in the internal KPIs that you watch now in July and August that give you confidence that you're still going to have outsized market share growth into '23.\nBrian Chesky: Dave, you want take this?\nDavid Stephenson: Yes. I mean we're continuing to see just really strong growth in our new guests. Obviously, looking at our new guests, our new guest retention, which is one of the questions we just had, which remains quite strong with people coming back on. We're continuing to see just overall utilization of Airbnb versus hotels. We didn't ever dip as much as hotels did, and we introduced Airbnb to millions of new customers. And we see the new use cases.  I mean, we've highlighted things like our long-term stays and the use cases where people aren't going to want to be at a hotel for more than 7 days. And so the portion of our business, nearly 50% that are over 7 days is really helpful in that regard and over 28 days, it's nearly 1/5 of our business. So we look at just the destinations that people are able to kind of travel. So the robustness of historically have been cross-border in urban. And now what we've seen is great growth in suburban and nonurban and some of the distribution of the nights around the world. I think that is also giving us great confidence in the growth of our business overall.  Because we don't just tap out. If we were only, say, a vacation rental destination-type company, you can tap out in either supply and even demand in those kind of areas. But that's really -- we have such a diversity of supply around the world that we're able to continue to grow quite well.\nBrian Chesky: Yes. Maybe I'll just -- Brian, maybe I'll add a little bit of context. It's good to remember that before the pandemic, our bread and butter was cross-border and urban, right? That was our bread and butter, it was cross-border travel and urban travel. And of course, when the pandemic occurred, that got primarily shut off, and yet our business recovered because people were using Airbnb differently.  I think that really the key important thing here is that our model is obviously incredibly adaptable. We are in nearly every community in the world. We have nearly every type of space at nearly every type price point. And I think that the reason that people would use Airbnb will continue to endure. People are looking for value. They want to feel like they live at the local. As more and more people have flexibility and trip trick length and continues to increase, nearly half of our business is a week or longer, it's prohibitive probably to stay in hotels. So there's a lot of new use cases that we think are here to stay. So the thing I'm pretty excited about is that a lot of the older use cases, cross-border and urban, are coming back.\nOperator: The next question is from Naved Khan with Truist Securities.\nNaved Khan: I'm really surprised by the continued strength in North America and in the U.S. I think you talked about a 37% growth in Nights and Experiences versus EMEA, maybe up 25%. Is it just that EMEA continues to lag? Or just from everything that we've been hearing, it seems like EMEA saw like a burst of demand in the second quarter. So just trying to reconcile that.\nBrian Chesky: Dave?\nDavid Stephenson: Yes. I mean EMEA is still lagging behind the acceleration that we've seen in North America, and we think that, that is actually one of the opportunities for future acceleration of the business. I mean, clearly, things like the impact of the war in Ukraine certainly has had an impact. And there's obviously the economic impact of even just foreign exchange rates, lower euro and British pound relative to the U.S. dollar. So there are some reasons why Europe has been lagging. It's still a strong business for us. It's still doing well, but it could even do better.\nNaved Khan: And then maybe just as a follow-up. So if I have to think about the back half and the advertising channels, do you see opportunity to increase the branded ad spend? Or do you think you're pretty much maxed out and might just stay on these levels?\nDavid Stephenson: Well, again, I think we have a very -- a modest increase in our overall marketing spend in the back half of the year. We're very happy with the approach to our brand spend. I mean, again, if you step back, one of the big strengths of Airbnb is our ability to market to both guests and hosts at the same time, to be able to bring guests with 90% of our traffic remaining direct or unpaid. And I think this brand strategy, frankly, it's more of a product marketing strategy that we have to market the features and capabilities that we have in Airbnb, what makes us different, has been a huge strength for us.  So we're really happy with that investment. We think we're investing fully at the moment there. We will look over time to maybe expand the countries that we're doing more of that investment. So later this year and into early next, you could see us expanding into more countries because we're seeing such good success with our investment right now.\nOperator: The next question is from Jed Kelly with Oppenheimer.\nJed Kelly: Great. Two, if I may. Just one on the nonurban listings, it continues to grow well, and you're adding a lot of supply. Can you sort of touch on where the share gains are coming from, like where those listings are coming from? Is it coming from people not using their second home as much and going back to more urban destination? Or are you taking more share with property managers? Or are you opening up with new destinations?  Then my second question just relates to over and all seasonality this year. It seems like the room nights is following a consistent seasonal trend as 2019. So should we expect a similar 4Q seasonality as 2019?\nBrian Chesky: Yes. So maybe -- why don't I -- I can at least answer the first not the urban listings at a high level. And Dave, you can answer maybe more specifically and also talk about seasonality. So Jed, at the highest level, I would say that one of the things that we've seen is that we have a global network where the fastest-growing market from a supply basis are typically the fastest-growing markets from a demand basis. And this is not surprising because the #1 source of host are prior guests.  So specifically in non-urban listings, it's -- it's not a uniquely different composition. It's not like it's a lot more property managers or anything like that. It's pretty consistent composition from years prior. So the vast majority of listings are individuals, but there are also property managers that are continuing to come out on the platform. We're also seeing people continue to open up more nights on their calendar. As demand goes up, people are often motivated to add more availability on their calendar.  And also as people get more business, they tend to tell their friends about it. And this is one of the great things about having a business where the vast majority of your supply are individuals. So we continue to see really strong growth in nonurban listings. But as urban recovers, we are anticipating that we're going to see some solid supply growth in urban areas as well. Dave, feel free to elaborate on that and take the second question as well.\nDavid Stephenson: Yes, I think you covered the first really well. I mean, I'll just say on the Nights and Experiences Booked kind of seasonality. Now that we kind of enter Q3 and Q4, it's probably just better to look at the year-over-year growth rates as kind of being more normalized. And I think that's the better way to kind of look at the overall seasonal growth.\nOperator: The next question is from Tom White with D.A. Davidson.\nThomas White: Brian, during the early days of the pandemic, you talked about narrowing your focus on Airbnb's most perishable opportunities. You guys have now achieved profitability at scale. Your cash balance has grown significantly. Can you update us on maybe your latest thinking about those nonperishable opportunities? Are any of them particularly attractive to you? Or should we maybe infer from the buyback announcement that maybe you're not super close to really exploring those opportunities again?\nBrian Chesky: Tom, yes. So again, during the 2020 pandemic curve, just to recap, we got really focused. We got back to basics. And over the last 2 years, I think we've really, really benefited by perfecting our core product. That being said, we are now looking and we are thinking very expansively. So you should look at our stock buyback as our confidence in our long-term growth and profitability. That's all you should believe that stock buyback's about.  That being said, we are going to continue to be investing aggressively over the coming years. So we are not pulling on the brake; we are now stepping on the gas. Remember, like the biggest innovations I had aren't going to be in my 20s and 30s, right? So we have some pretty big opportunities coming up. I'm excited about some of the things we're going to be releasing later this year, but we have another release coming next spring in time for the summer release and the following winter. And again, we're going to continue to focus on unlocking the next generation of host.  So we have some really exciting new products built to attract the next generation of host, especially individuals that want to host occasionally. We are going to continue to think of radical innovations around Airbnb becoming the ultimate host to our guests and host. We're going to continue to innovate on our search technology. And we have a lot of opportunities around helping people travel and live on Airbnb. So there's going to be some pretty exciting opportunities coming forward, and I'm pretty bullish about it. I don't know if, Dave, if there's anything you want to add to that?\nDavid Stephenson: Yes. I'll just reemphasize, our priority is investing in growth. And $10 billion cash is more than we need, $8 billion is more than sufficient to aggressively invest in growth in the business. And that is our #1 priority. At the same time, we're able to both invest and grow just given the profitability profile of our business overall. So I'm proud that we can do both, but the priority for us is investment growth.\nThomas White: Great. Maybe just one quick follow-up on FX. Over the years, I remember some of the kind of traditional OTAs talking about how maybe it's less about kind of the absolute level of one currency relative to another, but it's maybe more like the volatility of foreign exchange rates that kind of dictate customer booking behavior. Curious whether you'd say that was a similar dynamic in your business? Or just generally how to changes in FX rate, what changes impacts are you seeing kind of in terms of customer behavior?\nDavid Stephenson: I think the biggest impact you see with FX is in the cross-border travel, obviously, right? A strengthening dollar gives you the ability for Americans to travel abroad, specifically right now, probably Europe and to the U.K., and a weakening euro and pound makes it more difficult for them to kind of travel back. But again, if you look at Airbnb, the fact is that people adjust their travel to meet their overall kind of budgets. And as we saw in COVID, people are more willing to -- maybe they stay domestically if their budget doesn't allow the cross-border traveler. Maybe they stay domestically if they don't feel like they can afford the cost of airline travel. So the FX impact from a consumer standpoint is usually this kind of cross-border impact.  And then to our overall business, we're just seeing that as we generate nights stayed in euro and pounds and then we bring them back to the U.S. and into the U.S. dollar, we're just seeing the headwind of foreign exchange, which was -- which is material in Q1, it was 600 basis points of revenue growth driven by the FX move. So I'd anticipate Q3 probably be something less than that to our overall P&L.\nOperator: That will conclude our question-and-answer session for today. I'll hand it over to Brian Chesky for any closing remarks.\nBrian Chesky: All right. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us today. So I just want to say I'm incredibly proud of what we've delivered this quarter. Record Nights and Experiences Booked, we had our most profitable Q2, and we generated $795 million of free cash flow, bringing our total free cash flow over the last 12 months to nearly $3 billion. This transformation of our business was only possible because of our adaptable model and a relentless innovation.  And regardless of economic environment, we believe guests will continue to come to Airbnb because they can find great value and hosts can earn extra income. Airbnb is ready for whatever lies ahead, and we're so confident in our long-term growth and profitability that today, we're announcing a $2 billion share repurchase program. So thank you all for joining us today, and I'll see you next quarter.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "ABNB", "quarter": 1, "year": 2022, "date": "2022-05-03 23:03:07", "content": "Operator: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining Airbnb's Earnings Conference Call for the First Quarter of 2022. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations section of Airbnb's website following this call. I'll now hand over to Ellie Mertz, VP of finance. Please go ahead.\nEllie Mertz: Good afternoon, and welcome to Airbnb's first quarter of 2022 earnings call. Thank you for joining us today. On the call today, we have Airbnb's Co-Founder and CEO, Brian Chesky; and our Chief Financial Officer, Dave Stephenson. Earlier today, we issued a shareholder letter with our financial results and commentary for our first quarter of 2022. These items were also posted on the Investor Relations section of Airbnb's website. During the call, we'll make brief opening remarks and then spend the remainder of time on Q&A. Before I turn it over to Brian, I would like to remind everyone that we'll be making forward-looking statements on this call that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described under forward-looking statements in our shareholder letter and in our most recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained on this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. You should be aware that these statements should be considered estimates only and are not a guarantee of future performance. Also, during this call, we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures. We've provided reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in the shareholder letter posted to our Investor Relations website. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP results. And with that, I'll pass the call to Brian.\nBrian Chesky: All right, thank you very much, Ellie, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining. I'm excited to share our Q1 results with you. Now, despite the pandemic, the war in Ukraine and macroeconomic headwinds, Q1 was another incredible quarter. We exceeded 100 million Nights and Experiences Booked for the first time ever. GBV was $17 billion, which was 73% above Q1 2019. Revenue was $1.5 billion, exceeding Q1, 2019 by 80%. Net loss was $19 million. Now this is a significant improvement in the same periods from 2018 and 2021. Adjusted EBITDA was $229 million. Now, this is our first positive adjusted EBITDA Q1, and this represented adjusted EBITDA margin of a positive 15%. Now this is compared to a negative 7% a year ago, and a negative 30% in Q1 2019. And finally, we generated $1.2 billion of free cash flow in the quarter. This was also an all-time high. And what these results show is that two years into the pandemic, Airbnb is stronger than ever before. Now, why is this? Well, millions of people are now more flexible about where they live and they work. And as a result, they're spreading out to thousands of towns and cities. And they're staying for weeks, months, or even entire seasons at a time. That's through our adaptability innovation, we've been able to quickly respond to this changing world of travel. And these incredible results were driven by a number of positive business trends. First, guests are booking more than ever before. In Q1 gross nights booked grew 32% compared to Q1 2019. And this is despite the pandemic, the war in Ukraine, and macroeconomic headwinds. People are also more confident booking travel further in advance. And we're seeing strong demand for summer bookings and beyond. Second, guests are returning to cities and they\u2019re crossing borders. So our guests continue to travel domestically and continue to go to rural destinations at Airbnb. We are also seeing guests return to cities and cross borders at or even above pre-pandemic rates. Third, guest are also staying longer, even living on Airbnb. Now, while short-term stays rebounded strongly in Q1 2022, stays of a month or longer continue to be our fastest-growing category by tripling compared to 2019. In nearly half of our nights booked in Q1 were for stays of week or longer in one in five nights booked were for stays of a month or longer. So the world is clearly becoming more flexible about where people can work. And getting ahead of this trend, last week, we announced that Airbnb employees can live and work anywhere. And we've designed a way for them to live and work around the world, while collaborating in a highly collaborative way and experiencing the in-person connection that makes Airbnb special. Now fourth, our innovations are inspiring guests to discover thousands of new places. In 2021, we delivered more than 150 upgrades across every aspect of our service. And among these upgrades was the innovative I\u2019m Flexible feature. Now I\u2019m Flexible feature has now been used more than 2 billion times, 2 billion. And guests who use I\u2019m flexible are more likely to book home in less popular locations. This is really important, because this allows us to point demand to where we have supply, and it helps distribute guests more widely in communities all around the world. But we're not stopping there. On May 11, next Wednesday, we will be announcing the Airbnb 2022 summer release. This is a new Airbnb for a new world of travel. With a completely new way to search, guests will be able to discover millions of unique homes in Airbnb they never thought to search for. And when they book, guests will have the confidence knowing that Airbnb has their back each step of the way. And so you can watch this announcement right on our homepage next Wednesday at 9 AM Eastern Standard Time, next Wednesday, right on our homepage. I hope you can tune in because I'm really excited about what we have to share. And then finally, our community - our host community continues to expand. We see destinations the strongest demand showing this most supply growth with non-urban active listings actually growing 15% globally. And we're also showing an increase in total urban supply as demand returns to cities. And we believe that the upgrades we announced last year, including our new host onboarding flow and AirCover, are supporting this growth and enabling success for a new host. So to recap, we had our best Q1 ever. Nights and Experiences Booked and GBV were a highest ever. Revenue and adjusted EBITDA were records for Q1 and we generated more than $1 billion in free cash flow in the quarter. With these results, Airbnb is stronger than ever before. Now, before I go to question, I just want to talk for a minute about our efforts in Ukraine. Because over the past few months, millions of lives have been devastated by the war. And when the crisis broke out, we knew that our platform can help refugees fleeing the crisis. And within four days of the invasion, Ukraine, we announced that airbnb.org would provide free housing for up to 100,000 refugees fleeing from Ukraine, and over 30,000 hosts have already signed up to open their homes to refugees for free or for a discount. But then, something even more remarkable happened. People started booking homes for hosts in Ukraine. Hosts, they never intend to stay with just to provide relief aid. And soon, more than 170,000 people joined in, and they booked approximately 600,000 nights booked in Ukraine. And because we waived our fees, $20 million went directly to host in Ukraine. And I think this speaks to the power of our community. And they are a reminder that in the world of darkness and a world of destruction, kindness still exist. And so I'm really proud of our business results this quarter. I'm also proud of how helpful we've been able to be to thousands of people in need. And with all that, Dave and I look forward to answering your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Colin Sebastian with Baird. Please proceed.\nColin Sebastian: Thanks. Good afternoon, and congrats on the strong quarter. A couple of questions for me. I guess first off, Brian, drilling down a bit on some of the broader use cases that emerged through the pandemic. At a high level, the trends clearly sound very good. I'm hoping you could unpack that a little bit more in terms of the sustainability of longer stays and other use cases in markets that are furthest along in the recovery, where offices are reopening and lives are sort of getting back to normal, if you could able to break that down a bit more. And then secondly, on the plans for advertising and marketing, you're keeping that looks like fixed as a percentage of revenues, so a little bit higher spend on marketing and advertising. Can you talk about that? Is that with all the product updates, the rebound in travel, maybe the competitive landscape? If you could talk about the strategy with respect to the advertising and marketing? Thank you.\nBrian Chesky: Yes, excellent. Thanks, Colin. So why don't I answer these at a high level? And Dave, feel free to jump in with some more specifics. So let's start with the question of Colin, some of the broader use cases you talked about. And let's back up. So when we started Airbnb, it was really just a way for people to book a home for just a few days at a time. But even before the pandemic, actually long-term stays, stays of a month or longer were our fastest-growing category or segment of trip by trip length, some of those are already growing very quickly before the pandemic. And I think what the pandemic did, is I think it accelerated the adoption of longer-term stays in Airbnb by hard to say how many, but certainly by years, and I think it's important to understand why this is happening. Right now, what's happened is that for millions of people, they don't need to go back to an office five days a week. And the vast majority of companies are not requiring employees to come back to an office, many have moved to a hybrid or entirely remote model. And I think that what we're going to see going forward, is you're going to see more and more flexibility. Because I think companies ultimately want to attract the very best people, and the best people are going to be everywhere. And so long as we believe that people don't need to go back to an office five days a week, millions of people, then we believe in a world of more flexibility. So long as we believe in a world where people will continue to dial in and zoom, we will again believe in a world of more flexibility. And so what we are going to continue to see we think, over the coming years is continued and sustained growth for stays of longer than a month and stays of longer than a week. I don't think this is a temporary phenomenon. I think that the genie is out of the bottle and flexibility is here to stay. And I think flexibility after compensation will probably be the most important benefit that an employer can offer. And just to give you a small anecdote. Last week, last Thursday, we announced that Airbnb employees can live and work anywhere in the world. The response internally was great, but even more impressive was the response externally. Because a, our career page was visited 800,000 times after that announcement. And so I think that just speaks to the durability of this use case. And I think that it's going to continue. Now with regards to advertising, I think it's just important that I share a little bit of a recap of how we think about marketing and Dave, feel free to talk a little more detail. So we have, Colin, a little bit obviously different approach to marketing and advertising than our peers. We take a full funnel approach to marketing that combines PR, brand marketing and performance marketing. We're not really focused on buying customers. We're focused primarily in investing in our brand and educating the world about what makes Airbnb unique. So we think of marketing primarily as education. And I think this explains why 90% of our traffic or more is direct or unpaid. Airbnb is a noun and verb used all over the world, and it was really not advertising, but PR and word-of-mouth that built our brand. And just to give you an example, and - since the pandemic started, there have been more than 1 million articles written about Airbnb, 55% of articles that used to have the word travel in it, also have the word Airbnb in it. So it's pretty, so advertising is really a form of supplemental education for us. It's not the core driver of growth. We think the core driver of growth, Airbnb, is innovation. It's about building a product that people love. And the role of marketing isn't to buy customers. The role of marketing for us is to educate people about our new features and our new offerings. Dave, do you want to - I don\u2019t know if you want to go into a little more detail about advertising?\nDave Stephenson: Brian, I think you've covered it incredibly well. I mean, we're very proud of the approach to marketing this, the full funnel approach is working probably well for us. And as you said, we are actually increasing our marketing dollars. We're just keeping the marketing expenses as a percent of revenue relatively consistent to the level we had in 2021, and we think it's being really effective for us.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Bernie McTernan with Needham & Company.\nBernie McTernan: Great. Thank you so much for taking the questions. I guess first just want to get any insights on how supply and demand are growing relative to each other versus what was happening before the pandemic. So maybe even just utilization, how it's trending, how it was trending before the pandemic and how it's trending now. And then secondly, on capital allocation with over a $1 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, $9 billion of cash on the balance sheet. Can you remind us and just your thoughts on if there's any sort of capital allocation, whether it's returning to shareholders, M&A, and continuing to invest in the product? We'd love to hear your thoughts there.\nBrian Chesky: Great, Bernie. So why don't I do this? Let me just talk at a high level about the first question. And then Dave, why don't you take both questions at a more specific level. So let me just say at a high level around supply and demand, number one, I think we're going to have plenty of supply this summer for the demand. We're expecting a lot of demand for the summer. But we are not supply constrained any night of the year, not even close to the global level. The challenge of most travel companies is that a lot of people try to go to the same place, the same city on the same day. And cities, essentially, like travel OTAs typically get sold out. So like a lot of people try to go to New York City on New Year's Eve, and there's only so many places to stay in New York, and so you're going to get sold out. Now, here is Airbnb. We're in 100,000, towns and cities all over the world. And we see a couple phenomenon, I think it's important to point out. The first thing we see is the fastest-growing supply markets are actually our fastest-growing demand markets. So as a market experiences more demand, more supply gets unlocked. And I think the reason why is primarily because the vast majority of host of Airbnb are individuals. The vast majority of new host get a booking within three days. And when a regular person gets a booking, and the booking might be $300, $400 or $500, they tend to tell their friends about it. And so as more people get booked, they create more word-of-mouth, and this unlocks more supply. So we have a global network, where demand in a sense, stimulates more supply. Additionally, the I'm Flexible feature is critical, because it allows us to point demand to where we have supply. So if somebody types in Paris on June 4 to 5, we are limited to the properties in Paris on those dates. But if somebody says, we\u2019re flexible, we can point them to other dates in Paris that are a little lower season, or other towns around Paris to have available supply. So I think these are really important. But Dave, I don't know if you want to go into a little more specifics about either utilization and also kind of the capital allocation theory.\nDave Stephenson: Yes, just double click on a couple areas. I mean, one is we just have more supply than we've ever had in our history. And as Brian kind of mentioned on the call, the fact that we grow more supply in the areas that we have the greatest demand, like non-urban active listings grew 21% in North America, and 15% globally, it's the area where it's kind of self-healing, where we have the demand is where we end up having this supply. And this redistribution is also incredibly important. Because we have listings in all types of markets. We're not globally constrained at any given night, which is different than if you only had supply in one type of market. And then when demand spikes in that particular more narrow market type, like vacation rentals, you don't have anywhere else to distribute demand. But because we're all around the world, in every kind of community, we end up with the benefit of being able to redistribute demand to other places. So I think that's been incredibly strong for us. Regarding the capital allocation, yes, we have $9.3 billion that take as a CFO and the continued pandemic, having a strong balance sheet continues to allow us to sleep well at night. We have noted previously that we're going to use about $1 billion of our cash to pay for employee tax obligations as they exercise their shares. And so that will be a use of cash this year. And beyond that we're continue to be in growth mode, we will continue to have a balance sheet that enables us to be ready to invest when and where we find that it's appropriate. It does enable us to do M&A in the future, if desired. Although M&A is not our primary driver of growth, we still plan to grow organically as our primary means. But we'll continue to evaluate our balance sheet use and make sure that we are deploying capital appropriately.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mario Lu with Barclays.\nMario Lu: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. The first one for Brian, high level strategy question. So now that the total room nights has fully recovered versus 2019. How do you decide when is the right time to deaden the company's focus to other potential growth areas such as experiences, hotels and flights versus continuing to hone in on the core product?\nBrian Chesky: Great. Yes, so let me take that. So thanks, Mario. So basically, we learned some really important lessons during the pandemic. I started this company with my two friends when I was 26. I just turned 26 to start this company, and we had this enormous amount of success. And one of the things that happens when you're a first time entrepreneur, an enormous amount of success as you do something well, and you think you can kind of do everything well. And we pursue it a lot of things before the pandemic. And I remember growing up, my teacher said, you can do everything you want your life not at the same time, though. And I think that when the pandemic happened, there was a silver lining to our, to the crisis for us, which is we got really focused, we took all of our best people, we pause a lot of new initiatives. And we put our very best people on the most important problems, the company, which was stimulating core business. But I think what we saw is not only did that happen, but the total addressable market for short term stays is bigger than we ever imagined. And we are also able to extend it to long term stays. Our general approach now, going forward, is to be incredibly focused, we're going to absolutely be pursuing new opportunities. But we want to focus on the most perishable opportunities right now. And right now, the most perishable opportunity is this. Last year, we had what was probably the travel rebound in century, certainly I'd never seen the travel rebound, like last year since I started Airbnb. And I think this year is going to be even bigger than last year, because last year, it was a little bit tempered by the Delta and other strains. And I think what you're going to see this year is a true pickup of demand and cross border travel. So we're focused on this year is the perishable opportunity of trying to capture as much market share as possible, and get as many people who haven't traveled a couple years to try Airbnb, because for many people, Airbnb is no longer an alternative way to travel. It's the default. But that being said, we are absolutely looking at new opportunities and new services, nothing we pause from the pandemic that is out of -- is off the table to resume. And Airbnb experiences, for example, is a big area of investment in the coming years. And so we're starting to ramp up that product this year, I think more even more next year, you're going to see some major new offerings around Airbnb experiences and set a few demand. And I think that some of our best ideas are ahead of us, I'm 40. And I don't want to feel like the best ideas we had were in my 20s, or 30s. So I think that there's some really big opportunities going forward. But the name of the game is focused, just a few things at a time, the most perishable opportunities, get as much scale as possible, get that scale into an ecosystem, and then you can do a variety of line extensions for guest and for hosts.\nMario Lu: Great, thanks. Awesome. Thanks Brian. And then just one on the travel demand post the summer month. I know you guys talked about the fourth quarter seeing a little bit higher than historical. But how do we compare that versus the 30% figure that is provided in terms of this summer's travel, travel season? Is it higher or lower? Anything you can say in terms of the demand for summer?\nBrian Chesky: Yes, David, I\u2019ll let you take that.\nDave Stephenson: I'd say that with the 30% in the summer periods, we're seeing consistently that strong or stronger on a relative basis in Q4. I think that's the fact that people are willing to plan out into the fourth quarter that far, and higher rates than they've done in the past, it just shows the resilience that people have for traveling. So now the Q4 demand is as strong relative to the Q3 demand. We're stronger.\nOperator: The next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.\nBrian Nowak: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Brian, I have a couple for you, the $2 billion, did the $2 billion I\u2019m Flexible searches, yes, that's up quite a bit from $800 million last time around. I guess I'd be curious to hear about what are you seeing when people use that I\u2019m Flexile. Is that leading to higher conversion? Is that leading to higher utilization of some radius of the search sort of? What are you seeing that sort of driving that quick inflection of that product? And then to go back to your earlier answers about your innovation in your 40s now. What are still the areas on the host front where you see sort of low hanging fruit opportunities to improve it to drive more host growth?\nBrian Chesky: Yes. These are great questions, Brian, good to talk to you again. So yes, let me go. Let me start with guests. And let me then go to host. So you're right. I think that I don't mean just preface by saying that last year, we launched I\u2019m Flexible. The reason we launched it, as we saw more people were flexible. And the challenge is this, for 25 years, travel search has basically been the same. There's a search box, in the search box to ask you, where are you going, and it presumed that where you're going, in fact, you have to come to these websites for intent, and then ask you, when are you going, and so most OTAs aren't really in the business inspiration, they're in business of converting traffic into bookings. And this is good. But we always thought this, the holy grail of online travel was to inspire people about where to go. Now the results have been flexible has exceeded our expectations, it's been used 2 billion times. And for a travel product to be used 2 billion times and people on use travel product typically a couple times a year is pretty unusual. So what are we seeing the results, I think the primary thing we're seeing with I'm Flexible, is we're seeing a very strong amount of engagement. With I\u2019m flexible, people see a lot more properties and a lot more markets. We're seeing people booked properties outside of a lot of the popular tourist destinations. And we're seeing an ability to redistribute travel demand beyond the top popular hotspots like Rome, Paris, Las Vegas, New York, and Los Angeles. So that's really the most important thing that I'm Flexible can do. I'm Flexible, can be in the inspiration game and point the mandatory half supply. And so our measures of success are how often do people come back to the website? How many properties do they wish list? How frequently they came to the product on the inspiration side and on the demand side? How well re-pointing demand to where we have available supply, rather than just kind of being at the mercy of where they think they want to go, when they want to when they come to Airbnb. And so think that what are seeing in the Q1 results is that clearly the product is working because I think that I\u2019m Flexible as a feature has helped drive fair amount of that growth. Now with regard to the host price, you aright, it\u2019s very important that we continue innovate on the host side. Last year, we made a number of improvements to the host side of our product. Number one, our general principle is the easier your make something the more people do it. That\u2019s a really basic principle of the internet. If you make something easy, you reduce friction, more people do it. In hosting, the easier we make it the more people become host. So what we did last year as we reduced the number of steps to being a host to ten easy steps. We added a new product call ask a super host I think 170,000 prospective host have used the product. So where they have a question they can ask on our very best host. And then probably most importantly, Brian, importantly Brian, last year we launched air cover for host. Air cover provides a $1 million protection against property damage, a $1 million personal liability coverage and it\u2019s free, we did not charge anything incremental to our transaction free. And we're the only company and travel to offers this for free all these feature sets to our host. Now going forward this year, we have a number of new innovations that I'm really excited about. I'm not going to go into all the details, I'd like to kind of save it until we announce it. But I'll say at a high level, we are looking at features that bring more people into hosting ecosystem. So we want to provide even more ways to make it easier for hosts to list, we want to provide more support for them to make it easier to host. And we want to provide even more kind of control so people can decide, like who sees their property, when it's available, things like that. So we have some really exciting announcements. On May 11, you'll hear some interesting features that are going to be launching. And then we're also going to have a product released later in the year in November, as well. So we'll have a couple of big updates on those two fronts. But again, it's all about making hosting easier, and making it even more appealing for people who aren't host to become hosts. And if we can do that and make hosting mainstream that will fulfill our growth for years to come.\nOperator: The next question comes from Naved Khan with Truist Securities.\nNaved Khan: Yes, thanks a lot. Question for Dave. So, Dave, last time around you kind of set expectations for ADR to be down for the year in aggregate. Is that still where you expect to be and then what are you making in terms of this new product release that's coming up next week.\nDave Stephenson: Right on ADR, yes, what was shown in the past is that ADRs are up substantially from where they were back in 2019. So they were up 37% year over three years. And what we saw throughout the time in 2021, was that by Q4, about half of that ADR increase was driven by just mix. So regional mix like North America and Europe and the type of home so nonurban whole home and so mix was driving about half of the price appreciation. And then the other half was driven by price appreciation itself. So about half and half on the drivers are ADR. Here in Q1, price appreciation has become a larger percentage overall of the driver of ADR and mix has been a little bit less than half so it shifted even a little bit more. So what we're going to see and we've shown this in the outlook is that Q2 of this year ADRs will be relatively flat with Q2 of the prior year. And so they'll give you a sense that ADR will remain elevated, both due to mix and due to price appreciation. We think that they will likely moderate throughout the back half of the year as mix continues to adjust more towards cities more cross border which have lower average daily rates. But price appreciation has remained to be high and stickier. And so I think the level of decrease in ADR I think will be maybe lower than what we anticipated at the beginning of the year. And then, I think, give me more on your question around new product introductions that we'll be talking about next week. I\u2019ll give those details --\nNaved Khan: Yes, just details of contract -- just the contract, does your outlook contemplate any contribution from those products?\nDave Stephenson: Yes, I mean, our outlook for Q2 clearly includes a lot of the results from the investments we've made to date, and we're very bullish on these continued improvements to continue to drive the strong results that you've seen. So we're not giving kind of guidance out beyond Q2 at this time.\nOperator: The next question comes from Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse\nStephen Ju: Okay, thank you. So Brian, the rising consumer demand for longer term stays has been something you've been highlighting in terms of a fundamental change of behavior for some time now. So can you share with us how the reception from the host has been in terms of their willingness to accept longer term stays versus the more traditional shorter bursts? Because I guess what I'm trying to get at is whether there's any sort of extra push you guys may need to do in order to enable that longer duration supply with the 6 million hosts you have now? Or is this just a matter of demand, as you say, lighting up the supply? And I guess, second, I get that things are pretty depressed right now. But going back to the world pre-pandemic, like what were some of the bigger corridors of travel in Asia, so we can start thinking about what the shape of the recovery there can be? Thanks.\nBrian Chesky: Yes, thank you very much, Stephen. Now, yes. So let's start with rising demand for long term stays, what has been the reception of hosts? This is actually one of the most interesting points, I would say, which is, I think, when we really started looking at this category, my assumption was, it would be a different type of host, right? Some hosts wanted to list their place for short term basis. And other different hosts wanted to list their properties for a long term basis. And this is what you say, see on Craigslist, right? There's a short term stay category, and there's apartment categories, and they're not the same people. On Airbnb is totally different. The vast majority of hosts on Airbnb, who initially list their homes for a short term basis, have now included a monthly stay discount. And that's critical. So we have a large percent of people that have a monthly stay discount, or are available to host on a long term basis. So I think that's the most important thing I would say, which is that they absolutely are interested in it. Now, why are hosts interested in this? Well, there's a number of reasons. One is seasonality. Some people live in highly seasonal areas, where on high season, they want to rent by the night because they have a really great yield. But during low season, they have low occupancy. So they'll move to over a month. In some markets in urban markets. There are some restrictions on the number of nights, you can rent on a short term basis below 30 days. But they don't have restrictions on 30 plus days. So for the most part, what hosts see long term stays as is a way to increase their annual occupancy? And they generally want to go nightly, to get as many bookings as possible but during low season where there's limits to go to monthly, and they're really the same host. Now there are some hosts that only do short term, there are some hosts that only do long term, but what we see as generally open mindedness for most hosts to offer both. And the great thing about our product is you hardly had to do anything different to offer long term stays, having long term discounts is key. There's some new amenities, having verified Wi-Fi is important. And if you're going to live someplace, there's a number of like tactical things. But I think generally speaking, the product as it exists work for short term or long term stays, the vast majority hosts are open to it. So the answer is they're very receptive. Now, I think your second question was, what were the biggest corridors in Asia? Well, yes, so let's start. Asia is a highly cross border market. Let's kind of break it out Asia Pacific, I\u2019ll start actually with Australia, which is, of course, part of Asia Pacific. Australia is a primarily outbound market, and it's very much a cross border international market because obviously Australia is very much in a center quarter of globe. And so we're seeing a real rapid recovery in our Australian demand business. Japan has historically been an inbound business, and a lot of our demand in Japan has come from other countries. That is starting to see some uptick. But that's going to take a little bit of time. China is primarily an outbound business, people go to China, but primarily, they travel in deep China, and they go to other communities, especially around Asia. And what we see in Southeast Asia primarily is these are absolutely inbound and outbound markets, they're very much cross border. So I guess the high level is the vast majority markets in Asia Pacific are cross border, a lot of that travel is intra-Asia travel. There's a fair amount of travel though, where it's inside and outside of Asia. And I'm very, very optimistic about the ability of our Asia business to more than fully recover. Because what we've seen is the longer people can travel, the more pent-up demand there is. I don't think travel ever is going to go out of style, people are going to continue to travel. And so I think that we're very, very optimistic that Asia is going to follow the recovery curves of Europe, North America and Latin America, just on a little different timescale. And sorry, just to give you one step, just to give you a couple of stats, on the first question, 87% of all available listings on Airbnb accept long term stays. 52% of hosts offer a monthly discount. And these discounts are 85% of our long term stays.\nOperator: The next question comes from James Lee with Mizuho.\nJames Lee: Great, thanks for taking my questions. Two here. I'm just curious, is inflation having an impact on consumer behavior? Maybe, for example, consumer trading down on hotels to home accommodation, and also in terms of market share within home accommodation, as you see mix shift to urban markets, we have strengthened supply, how's that compare versus your peers who may be more non-urban focus? Thanks.\nBrian Chesky: Yes, maybe why don't we do this day? Why don't I answer a high level of the second question, because I just wanted to share a point about our urban business? And then maybe you can go into the details about both inflation impact on consumer behavior and kind of how we're comparing to our peers in urban markets. James, the thing I would just say about our business is, I think that our business is uniquely resilient in a uniquely adaptable model. And the reason our model is adaptable is because we are not just the US business. We are not just the European business. We are a global business and we are strong in Europe, North America, Asia, Latin America, Africa, we're global. We're in 220 countries regions, one of those global companies in the world. We're not just a vacation rental business. We're vacation rental markets. But our bread and butter is urban, cross border was really how we got our start. So we're very much an urban, a rural vacation and an off the grid, we even have homes totally off the grid. We have homes that are 20, 30 bucks a night and 10s of 1000s of dollars a night. So we're really at all price points. We have catered to families and individuals. So we have nearly every type of home at every price point, and every type of space and nearly every type of community around the world. And so I think that we've been able to be uniquely resilient. And the other thing I want to say about our urban market business, is we're seeing record long term stays. I'm doing this call, for example, from New York City, Airbnb, where I have for a month. And we're seeing in New York City, for example, a huge uptick in long term stays, because a lot of people have to come here, working remotely for months at a time. So that's just a little bit of how we think about it. Dave, I'll hand it over to you and go to a little bit more detail.\nDave Stephenson: Yes, I mean we're just not seeing price appreciation impact our business negatively. We had our strongest quarter ever, we have even stronger demand for Q3 and Q4 than we've ever had. And I think Brian hits right in the head because we have every type of home and every type of community, everything from budget, shared homes to luxury homes, people can make a choice about what kind of property fits their particular budget and their needs. And so I think it's that strength of diversity of product that will continue to support our business going forward. And then I think you also hit on it, which is this mix shift to urban markets, which has traditionally been our strength at Airbnb, when you compare it to others who don't have the same amount of supply and capabilities build in those cities. It's going to give us kind of a further tailwind. And really what we're seeing right now is continued strength of the domestic business that was up 65% versus 2019. Strength in our non-urban business is up 80% versus Q1 2019. And that remains incredibly strong. And now we're seeing the mix shift towards urban markets back towards 2019. And across border back to 2019. And so I think that tailwind is going to continue to help our business going forward.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jed Kelly with Oppenheimer.\nJed Kelly: Hey, great, thanks for taking my question, just thinking about on how higher interest rates in like a potential recession, how do you think that would impact your supply? And then just thinking about the top line from the back half of the year with AIPAC opening up, and more and more cross border more urban, do you think revenue or I guess bookings will be driven more by volume? Or by ADRs? Thank you.\nBrian Chesky: Yes, so why don't I take the first question about higher interest rates or recessions impact on supply and Dave to take the second question. Jed, no way to know for sure, on your question, but I'm pretty sure I've a sense of it. Airbnb, we launched on August 11, 2008. So you'll remember what the world was like in August 2008. And we really got going January, February, March of 2009, in the depths of the Great Recession. And the reason that Airbnb initially grew was that people were having trouble paying their rent, having trouble keeping their homes, and people turn to Airbnb to list their homes. And what we generally see is in recessions, people change their behavior. And they change their behavior based on kind of price considerations. And so will generally expect in a recession, if that were to happen, is that probably more people would turn to hosting. That would be number one. So that we would expect, and number two, travelers would probably become more budget conscious. And that would probably have a benefit to Airbnb as well. Now, the downside, of course, the recession is often times fewer people travel. But again, I think we're a pretty resistant business, whether it's economy's good or bad, we're pretty adaptable model. So that's what I would expect in the supply side, that's the more difficult to the economy is, the more people are going to need supplemental income. And a lot, a handful of them will turn to hosting. Dave, I'll hand it over to you.\nDave Stephenson: Yes, and just to double click on that, I think in a recessionary environment, if people are more constrained on the dollars they have to spend to travel, they often will come back to Airbnb because we're a better value in that travel. And going back to the earlier point, we have all types of price points, budget to deluxe, and consumers can figure out what meets their best budget needs. And so I think it actually, we are a better option than many other alternatives in a recessionary environment. And then, in terms of the back half of the year expectations, revenue will be driven more by volume than ADRs. We give our outlook on ADRs for Q2 of being flat year-over-year, they may moderate a little bit in the back half depending on mix. But I think that the biggest driver of revenue, maybe outperforming current expectations would be a further strengthening of the European business or acceleration of that maybe normalization of cancellation rates across the globe could also be a tailwind. APAC coming back more strongly more quickly will certainly help the results. But I don't think it'd be the major driver this year. North American and European travel is still just such a large percentage of our business at the moment. APAC will be super important over the long term, but less of an immediate driver here in 2022.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mark Mahaney with Evercore.\nMark Mahaney: Okay, Brian want to applaud you, by the way for your efforts with the Ukraine, you came up with a creative and direct way for people to help out. So I applaud you for that. And then I also want to give you some comfort in terms of your thoughts on innovation and age. I think most studies show that peak innovation occurs when people reach 50. So if you can just make it through the next 10 years, you'll be good. And then finally, just because you touched most of the questions I've thought about were already been asked, but let's get back to experiences. So it sounded like maybe you're, I know you got the core business and that's what you're really focused on. But it sounds like you may start leaning in a little bit more to experiences so just flesh that out a little bit and I know it's relatively small versus the core opportunity now but, at some point I assume you're going to lean more aggressively into experiences. And I assume that there'll be host demand to do that. So because there's probably a lot of win-win all around that. So just talk about the timing of when you think you may want to lean more aggressively into experiences. Thank you.\nBrian Chesky: All right. Well, thanks, Mark. It's great to hear from you again. First of all, yes, I'm 40. I hope I got a good 10 years in me and I think I'm a pretty late bloomer, so maybe give even more than 10 years. And so what I want to do at that time, well, one of the things I want to do is experiences. I think that experiences is a massive, massive opportunity. When we started Airbnb, air homes took off. And I remember saying at the time, Mark, well, we've monetized people's biggest asset already, which is their home, what do we do next, we go to the next largest asset. And it actually turns out your home is not your largest asset from a latency standpoint, I think it's your time for most people, your time ultimately can generate more revenue for the average person than their property can. And so that's a bit of an insight of where experiences came. It also came from the fact that a lot of people book Airbnb not just to save money, but to have a local travel experience. And I think experiences are a great way to do that. And so I was expecting 2020 to be the breakout year for experiences, we prepared for that. And of course, the opposite happened, the pandemic occurred, and we put the product on hold. In the last two years, when people aren't really comfortable leaving their house they have to mask on, it's not really been the right conditions to double down on experiences. But now that the light is at the end of the tunnel of the pandemic, we think people's first trips won't be to meet strangers and go on experiences, we think the first trips we want to have are to reunite with family, unite with friends get a big home together. And so we think that this summer, though people will book experiences, I think the summer still a little more about homes, just because people are getting comfortable getting out of their house. That being said, I think this summer, you're going to start to see a ramp up of experiences, I think next year and beyond it\u2019s going to be a massive opportunity and I\u2019m incredibly excited about it and one of the reasons I am so excited about it is that our guest actually, from a customer satisfaction standpoint, like experience more than homes, they actually leave a significantly higher five star rating as a percentage of their ratings for experiences at home. The people like home, the retention is really good. So we think this is just scratching the surface. And so to answer your question definitively, we are going to be ramping up, we're going to be getting more aggressive experiences, we will be a slower on ramp in this year, but by next year, we're going to be going full throttle. And I'm really excited about this opportunity. And it's a little hard, I don't want to make too many predictions about how big it will become. But my general sense is it's kind of probably bigger than most of us imagined, just because I think people are looking for interesting things to do with people. People are lonely, they want to meet one another, they want to do activities, they can only go to so many restaurants, they can only watch so many shows on Netflix, and many physical communities are being digitized. And so people ultimately want to have real experience in the real world. I think travel is a great way to do that. And the final thing I'd say Mark, is the increasingly people aren't just booking homes in Paris, you go to Paris, you can see the Eiffel Tower, you can go to Loire. But if you go to a small town in France, what do you do other than go to a restaurant, experience is a great way to do something interesting in nearly every community in the world, especially ones that don't have the Eiffel Tower. So that's -- those are just some of the reasons why I am incredibly bullish about this product. But it's going to take some time to really wrap up.\nOperator: The next question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America,\nJustin Post: Great, thank you. Well, lot of my question has been answered. But on the urban supply side, I imagine you had some churn on health issues and other factors. What are you seeing in urban markets? And could you see a big uptick there as demand comes back? How are you thinking about that? And then maybe one follow up.\nBrian Chesky: Yes, Dave, do you want to take this one?\nDave Stephenson: Sure. I think one of the key things remember about our supply is that the vast majority of our hosts are individual hosts. And they don't get rid of their home. And they're using their own home or maybe a second home to host. And so even in the midst of a pandemic, or other kind of recessionary environment they are not getting rid of their own home or their second home, which means that they're ready for hosts, and there'll be there when the demand is coming back. And that's what we're seeing now with our urban demand. So the urban demand is starting to come back. It's now back towards night 2019 levels, and our hosts are ready for them and our growth in hosts in the urban markets has also increased. So we're seeing an increase in our listings for both our high density and urban markets overall. And that's what we kind of continue to see as the demand comes back, the supply is there to meet it.\nJustin Post: Right and then follow up on ADRs, I think you're saying around flat year-over-year, can you just talk about the normal seasonality for ADRs? Why -- is it mix that they caused them to down? And how does it -- how do you think about the back half seasonality on ADRs?\nDave Stephenson: Yes, I think if you could, again, we have been up 5%, year-over-year in Q1, it is going to be flat relative on year-over-year basis in Q2, you can kind of see a little bit of a decrease of seasonality for Q3, Q, you can maybe look at some of the seasonality back to \u201819, which will show you that Q3 and Q4 have moderately lower ADR is not substantially, I think you could use that as a little bit of a guide. And then just know that the mix change is being offset a lot by strong price appreciation that is continuing to prop up the ADR overall. So I think that is a bit of the unknown for exactly where ADR is going to land in the back half of the year, what I can see is very clearly what's going to happen in Q2, which will be flat year-over-year.\nOperator: The next question comes from Rohan Joshi with Citi.\nRohan Joshi: Great, thanks for taking the question. I want to ask a little bit more about cross border, just given the rebound that we saw this quarter and rebounds and seeing just can you talk about the dynamics maybe Brian on whether there's cross borders, mostly call it North America users going overseas? Are we seeing more EMEA users coming to US or any sort of insights around there? And then Dave, on just overall EBITDA, understood, more leverage and margin expansion in the first half. But it's really impressive to see the continued call it leverage across most of your line items. Can you just remind us ops and support and gross margin, what's driving that? Thank you.\nBrian Chesky: Yes, hey, Rohan, I can just start the cross border is I would say North America, Europe, Australia, Latin America, pretty much everywhere, but Asia, and it's really going in all directions. So people are coming into North America, people in North America are leaving. They're absolutely going to Europe, there's a lot of travel within Europe. And we're now also seeing Europeans come to the United States and go kind of in other locations as well. So the great thing is the network effect is kind of moving in multiple directions. Whereas, say, last year, it was much more domestic and kind of really limited, the corridors are really starting to open. So Dave, I'll let you take the rest of the answer.\nDave Stephenson: Yes, on the EBITDA, I'm really pleased and proud of the work that we've done to improve our overall profitability, we made some really difficult choices in the midst of the pandemic, to reduce our overall workforce and focus on the core of our business. We think that actually, that focus is enabling us to deliver even more like, I think we've actually delivered more innovation and productivity as a company by being very deliberate focusing in a more narrow area versus trying to do everything all at once. And that's been really effective with this. We actually have 16% fewer people at the end of Q1 \u201822, than we did at the end of Q1 2020, before we had our layoffs, and yet, we think we're being more productive than ever before. And then we're getting nice. So on top of that fixed cost leverage, yes, we're getting nice improvement in our variable costs, and our options support, it was 15% of revenue here in the first quarter, and seeing nice improvement versus our ops and support in a prior quarters, right. Option support will include, largely our community support operations, and our trust and safety activities. Those are the elements that are within ops and support, we're going to continue to invest in those areas, because we think those are differentiators for us and they doing those really well supports our individual host community. But we're making nice strides and improvement in leverage, so that we gain continued profitability. And one of the things we noted in the letter is that we're expecting for the full year, a modest expansion in our overall EBITDA margin rate. So that's nice to see versus 2021. And I'm really excited that in 2022, we'll have our first full year of net income profitability. So just not a full net income basis to be profitable this year feels excellent.\nOperator: The next question comes from Lee Horowitz with Deutsche Bank.\nLee Horowitz: Great. Thanks for taking the questions, two, if I could. High level demand across the -- accommodation industry has proved incredibly sticky to the front half of this recovery and your comments suggest even into the back end. To what do you kind of owe this stickiness and consumer patterns in terms of the way that they travel even as things open up and hotels, perhaps gain a bit of share? And then maybe a bit on cost as well, wage inflation and its inability to kind of find talent has been cropping up across a lot of the names that we cover. You guys haven't necessarily commented too much here. But how if at all are you seeing wage inflation potentially play from the model as we move through 2022? Thanks so much.\nBrian Chesky: All right. Dave, do you want to take it?\nDave Stephenson: Sure.\nBrian Chesky: Sorry. Can I actually can I ask a clarifying, I don't quite understand the first question. Can you ask it again?\nLee Horowitz: Yes, in terms of you --\nBrian Chesky: The way that question -- yes, can you clarify the first question? About first question consumer demand --\nBrian Chesky: The industry. Yes, for alternative accommodations and proven incredibly sticky. Despite reopening more host are coming online, those sorts of things, I guess, to what do you owe this kind of stickiness in consumer travel patterns?\nBrian Chesky: Oh, why is it sticky? Are you -- so sorry, I want to make sure I understand. Are you saying why? It like it was obvious why people were booking homes last year because people weren't traveling for business. They weren't going to urban markets. They weren't crossing borders. They were staying nearby. So you're asking why \u2013\nLee Horowitz: They were \u2013\nBrian Chesky: Trying to reopen -- why they're still sticky. Okay, got it. Yes. Okay, I got it. Thank you. And then let me do that. And then Dave, you can take the second question. So I mean I think it's important to just note Lee that, like we were growing really fast before the pandemic. And the reason we are growing fast is number one, I think a lot of people want to have a local experience they travel number two, they want to save money when they travel. Number three, Airbnb allows them to travel with groups, and increasingly people are traveling in groups. Number four, Airbnb allows them to travel and stay in nearly every community in the world, hotels on unlimited markets around the world. And number five, the longer you're away from home, the more you want to be in a home and length of stay is going up. So I think all those reasons explain the stickiness. Maybe said another way, there's another way of saying rural demand increased during the pandemic, and people are still traveling to rural areas. People are still traveling domestically, which was a very popular demand use case during the pandemic, people don't have to go back to the office five days a week. So people are still booking weekly stays and monthly stays. So again, domestic, non-urban, in longer stays, were three use cases that weren't really our original bread and butter, our original bread and butter was urban cross border short term. But these three trends are sustaining, they're still sustaining. And the reason why is I think the genie is out of the bottle, people have permanent flexibility. And people now realize there's a lot of great places to go beyond the top 100 tourist destinations. That being said, what we're seeing is a recovery of cross border in urban, it's actually both above 2019 levels. So in short, the old ways, the bread and butter of Airbnb, cross border, urban are back in the new use cases or the use cases that were accelerated at pandemic are here to stay. And the combination of those two things is why I think this business is so sticky, maybe a more fundamental way of saying it is people love the experience they have. And so when people love them, they tend to do more of it. Dave, I'll hand over to you.\nDave Stephenson: Yes, in terms of wage inflation, this we did $1.5 billion of revenue in Q1 with just 6,200 people. And we don't need as I said, we actually have 16% fewer people than we did in Q1 of 2020. We don't need to add incremental people to have this business grow dramatically, we are significantly larger today as a business with significantly fewer people. So really, wage inflation is not a really major driver of costs. We are investing in our employees in order to enable them to live anywhere, move anywhere within the country. If they move someplace else, we're not going to alter their pay for being in a different part of the country. And we're going to support them work 90 days in other countries around the world. So we think that kind of investment will benefit us by having lower attrition, and being able to attract the best talent in the world. So we think that's going to be a great investment for the future, to have the best talent to unlock all the innovation that Brian has talked about on the call today. That concludes the Q&A session. I would like to pass the conference back to Brian Chesky for additional remarks.\nBrian Chesky: All right. Well, thank you all for joining us today. I'm incredibly proud of what we accomplished this quarter. We hit new records with nights and experiences booked and GBV. We had our first positive Q1 adjusted EBITDA and our highest free cash flow ever $1.2 billion of cash flow. But we're just getting started because we are going to be accelerating our pace of innovation. And I'm really excited to announce the biggest change to Airbnb in a decade. It's going to be next Wednesday, May 11 at 9 AM Eastern Standard Time, you can watch a special event right from our homepage. Until then, thank you. I'll see you soon.\nOperator: That concludes the Airbnb Q1 2022 earnings call. Thank you for your participation.
